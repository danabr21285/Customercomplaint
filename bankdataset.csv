1,11/20/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I have had our mortgage for over 20 years and ever since Bank of America took over our original mortgage company Countrywide, I have had on going issues. I have been trying to be able to prepay more than one periodic payment without it being applied to principal balance of the loan. I want to be able to make payments as often as I choose and for the life of the loan. 
I have spoken on the phone with the main customer service several times over the years. They would post my payments incorrectly. Each time I spoke to someone, I was given different instructions and was told flat out that I could not make additional payments at any time or make prepayments. With no explanation or help. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke on separate occasions to 2 agents XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). They both said that Bank of Americas policy was not allow early payments. Frustrated, I spoke to the Bank of America XXXX, XXXX branch manager. She tried to help, so it seemed, but nothing was resolved. 

Another phone call to customer service, I mentioned the clause I found in my statement below. I was told to mail a written request. Which I did on XX/XX/XXXX and have yet to receive a response or resolution. 

Paying your loan ahead You may prepay your periodic payments one month in advance. If you want to prepay more than one periodic payment, please contact us. Keep in mind that if you dont contact us or we dont receive written instruction from you, and you attempt to prepay more than one periodic payment, we will apply those payments to the principal balance of the loan. 

Then I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, regarding our homeowners insurance premiums. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the phone number XXXX listed on the letter to get some clarification. The recent letter was notification that Bank Of America paid our homeowners insurance premiums on our previous and current insurance policies, so youll need to cancel one of them and send us your premium refund. What did this mean??? 
First thought was, did our homeowners policy company change? SecondIf so, why were we not notified? Then of course confusion and so many other questions and concerns came up. After speaking to someone about this, she confirmed that our homeowners insurance policy holder was not changed and the last payment was XXXX. And that its all caught up and that the letter must have been sent in error. 
So, I asked the XXXX  lady about my previous issue. I explained all to her and she gave me another address to which I can send my concerns and complaints. I am sending it certified mail Monday XX/XX/XXXX. In the letter I advised them that I was also filing a claim with you. 
Every time I try to work with this bank, I have issues. Everyones hands are tied, employees are uninformed or show lack of knowledge of policies, XXXX etc. And no communication.

This Spring, we received a secured property tax from XXXX XXXX XXXX, specifically Escaped back taxes for XXXX XXXX ( {$3400.00} ). In XX/XX/2022, when we initially contacted BOA about this tax bill, we were told that this tax bill was BOA 's responsibility and it would be paid out of our escrow. Several weeks later we noticed that the tax bill was still not paid, and when we called to check on the status of the payment, we were told that they were still working on payment. We called back later again to speak to the BOA escrow department, and at that point were told that it was our responsibility to pay this tax bill. At this point, we were already being charged a late fee ( {$380.00} ) which we could have avoided if we had been given the correct information ( that the Escaped Back Taxes were our responsibility ) when we initially called. We believe that the late fee should not have come out of our escrow but should have been paid for by BOA because of the incorrect information we were given when we initially asked for guidance. 

This Fall, we've had to chase down the BOA mortgage to pay our property tax bill as well. Initially, we noticed that there was no fund extracted or prepared for the property tax due in XXXX. We called BOA and they gave us the completely wrong property tax amount ( half of what was actually due ), which I corrected. The next time I called back, they confirmed that they had the correct property tax amount which was being prepared to be paid. This has yet to happen.

The investor further informed me that an exterior BPO is typically performed for PMI cancellations, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating the investor says it can be an interior or Exterior. 

Very confusing and more road blocks. This conflicts with what the investor told me. 

I previously requested Bank of America about an overage in my escrow account, Bank of America informed me it was there policy to only look at escrows once a year and that would be next year. 

I filed a complaint saying thats illegal and only after filing the complaint did they return the overage.

XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  PDT To : XXXX Cc : XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX There has been no response to my correspondence below of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Adding to the active complaint filed with the CFPB that your client has removed access to make automated monthly payments on my mortgage. I have made XXXX attempts to date to timely pay my XXXX mortgage via automated telephone system, which has been regularly used for over XXXX years. In a pattern of retaliatory action, your client has removed my access to do so, just as it did last summer. 

This causes hardship. Your client has closed their branches near me, preventing payment from being made in person. It has demonstrated prior patterns of holding payments posted to them/not timely cashing them, then falsely trying to demand late fees. 

This note serves as notice of addition of this complaint as a result of the retaliatory act by your client and intent to pursue damages to the full extent allowed for any payments not processed as timely while this matter is resolved. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX cc : CFPB On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, A XXXX XXXX wrote : Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX : I had no such knowledge that your firm was still counsel for Bank of America , N.A. ( BANA ) because it has failed to respond since the items delineated in my complaint of XXXX to the CFPB were submitted. This was after after your firm failed to respond to numerous follow ups from on or about XXXX through XXXX. 

The email of XX/XX/XXXX from your firm fails to address the XX/XX/XXXX complaint either timely or any of its contents, so it can not serve as a response. It appears your firm failed to read the complaint and the numerous follow ups over XXXX consecutive years sent to your firm. 

Nothing has been alleged. Facts have been submitted confirming the pattern of intentionally negligent misrepresentation combined with repeated new acts, in addition to violations of the settlement agreement of XXXX. Documentation has repeatedly been provided of patterns of intentionally negligent misrepresentation including but not limited to : ( 1 ) failing to provide timely mortgage statements ( 2 ) failing to correct accounting in mortgage statements ( 3 ) committing elder abuse by harassing an XXXX year old family member who is a XXXX survivor about mortgages they are not a party to in any manner ( 4 ) failing to abide by terms of mortgage agreement ( 5 ) failing to update my address ( 6 ) fraudulently misrepresenting mortgage terms ( 7 ) balance of items delineated in my complaint Your clients records are incorrect. Your firm, as a representative of your client, had a duty to advise it of same when I provided repeated advice all prior charges for late and/or delinquent payments during the period the mortgage statements had not been mailed to the correct address. The several months of missing statement have neither been been provided to the proper address, nor has my address been corrected to date. Nor was any evidence provided in your communication that false charges were reversed or credited. 

Disagreeing with a characterizations does not change the fact of documented patterns of intentionally negligent actions, which were clearly communicated repeatedly from their repeated occurrences on or about XXXX through on or about XXXX. This is in fact a pattern of action that likewise occurred prior to the settlement agreement. Your client was made fully aware of these patterns prior to settlement in XXXX and has repeated them through XXXX with full knowledge of prior acts, in clear bad faith. 

Despite your clients and your firm- along with several other firms who your client included - being made fully aware of such pattern of elder abuse, new act ( s ) were again committed after settlement. 

The suggested resolution described in my complaint was a generous offer provided for the documented pattern of acts of intentionally negligent misrepresentation that are not subject to any prior XXXX or XXXX. It was also a gracious offer to settle your clients violations of our XXXX settlement agreement. Your client may choose to accept the suggested resolution within five ( 5 ) business days, otherwise it may be subject to full public disclosure, publication, action to the full extent of the authorities and/or legal action, including but not limited to turning over all documentation for class action, for which it is understood there may be substantial interest.

When Bank of America sold the mortgage, it incorrectly shared information with XXXX XXXX that I did not make payments ( {$4000.00} ) in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX.

32,6/10/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Subject of the complaint : A notice dated XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America was mailed to XXXX XXXX stating that the interest rate of our mortgage loan that they own and service will increase by 0.750 % for 272 months and a final balloon payment of {$250000.00}. We adamantly state again that this mortgage loan modification issued by XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX is fraudulent. The original loan was {$330000.00} and the loan modification exploded it to {$720000.00} which includes a balloon payment of {$210000.00} has a 44 yr. term with escalating interest rates. Additionally, without notifying us, Bank of America extended the loan term to 52 years. We state that the mortgage loan is fraudulent because of documented proof that it was derived from mortgage fraud consisting of unlawful financial policies, manipulated processing times, misrepresentation of information and illegal business practices. 
Purpose of the complaint : We are again appealing to Bank of America on legal, moral, ethical and humane grounds to stop perpetuating this mortgage crime and grave injustice done against the XXXX family. There is urgency to this complaint because Bank of America is about to implement the most formidable and financially damaging period of our mortgage loan. As a hard working family of XXXX descent with roots in XXXX and XXXX we are living in our home for the past 27 years. However we attribute this achievement and our survival from losing our home not only to our persistent tenacity to fight against the injustice done against us but primarily to our faith in the power of Almighty God. 
We are aware that Bank of America has stated exemption from any blame of mortgage fraud related to the mortgage loan that they currently own and service on our home. Their basis for this claim is that it was not them, but XXXX XXXX XXXX that processed the terms and conditions of our loan. But to us their position is analogous to thieves laundering their stolen money in a bank that benefits from the profits and when confronted about the crime they claim innocence or ignorance. Similarly, the case with our home is analogous to a hard working, honest, individual who was criminally and purposefully setup for theft of {$720000.00} and was sentenced to 52 years of punishment for a crime they did not commit. 
Our perspective : We are among the thousands of US citizens, and particularly those of XXXX descent who were victimized by massive mortgage financial crimes committed in XXXX. Our current monthly payments continue to feed the greed of investors with dividends from our fraudulent mortgage loan that was encased in a toxic asset titled XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX. The illegal business strategy all servicers applied to our loan over the 10-yr period was implemented on several levels. First was the abusive and premature action to begin the foreclosure process after only two missed payments and while we were making full monthly payments. Second was the persistent practice of ignoring phone calls and letters about our loan. Third, were the incessant requests by servicers for the exact documents that we had previously submitted. Fourth was the repeated submission of loan modification applications with no approval. Fifth was the practice of changing servicers who regularly demanded starting over the application process. However, the most pervasive strategy was the purposeful and unconscionable manipulation of processing time to extend it so that the excessive charges, missed payments and miscellaneous fees including monthly inspections of the property will accumulate to a financially insurmountable amount. The ultimate goal was for us lose our home. 
Synopsis of the complaint : All information is backed by documentation ) Prior to responding to a solicitation to refinance in XXXX, we had lived in our home for ten ( 10 ) years. The loan was originally made to XXXX XXXX and spouse XXXX XXXX in XXXX each with 50 % ownership certificates to XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX we refinanced for {$330000.00} at 10 % for 30 yrs. with XXXX XXXX XXXX. There were two closings. The loan was finally made to XXXX XXXX and son, XXXX XXXX. Interest rate was to be lowered if we paid the {$2500.00} on time for 6 months and we did. But also six months later the former owners sued the title company XXXX XXXX for issuing a fraudulent title deed with their forged signatures. Refer to court XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We incurred {$25000.00} in legal fees to litigate clearing of the title. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - Countrywide XXXX XXXX. Two periods of unemployment and legal costs caused us to miss two mortgage payments. XXXX XXXX resumed work in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX soon also after. Payments resumed from XXXX. Our request to put the two payments at the end of the loan was repeatedly refused. 
XXXX Countrywide  returned mortgage payments made in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX stating that our home was in foreclosure proceedings. We sent the first letter requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. Countrywide  did not respond. 
XXXX we sent six letters to Countrywide  XXXX  XXXX requesting mortgage forbearance or any other applicable loan modification option. No response. 
XXXX The case involving title deed, lasted 3 yrs and was settled with the title cleared and plaintiffs receiving {$25000.00}. We requested an application from Countrywide  for the Home Affordable Mortgage Program offered by the Obama administration for which we more than qualified. Total income was {$82000.00} per yr. No response. We also contacted Senator XXXX for assistance. He responded but was not able to change conditions. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank of America XXXX Countrywide  XXXX XXXX. The same problem of no response to our request for a HAMP loan modification application continued. Instead, they offered in-house loan modification programs for {$2800.00} to {$4000.00} monthly. We declined offers and continued to request application for HAMP program that was developed for home owners like us. 
XXXX - New servicer- a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX offered HAMP application but maintained the same business policy of repeatedly requesting the same documents with no loan approval. b ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX filed a status report for foreclosure action against us. We responded XXXX XXXX requesting with stated reasons that the court dismiss the plaintiffs action with prejudice. The foreclosure case was placed on hold. 
XXXX a ) On legal advice XXXX XXXX XXXX for bankruptcy to qualify for approval under a loan modification program in Florida. The program required paying XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX {$1400.00} per month through bankruptcy court and attending mediation for XXXX weeks. We complied with both, and paid a total of {$30000.00}. b ) On XX/XX/XXXX when XXXX denied the loan modification application stating insufficient income. This was most offensive because XXXX purposefully disregarded repeated submission of combined income from XXXX resident family members. They chose to isolate XXXX 's income and use for evaluation. Combined income was {$60000.00}. 
XXXX a ) XXXX XXXX XXXX told our attorney to have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bank statements showing that we pay rent to him. We absolutely refused on the legal grounds of falsifying documents and violating the citys residential code about property. b ) XXXX asked the attorney to have XXXX father deposit his social security check into XXXX bank account. We again refused this illegal request, and mutually ended legal services. We filed our XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint against Select Portfolio Servicing for their illegal business practices with purposeful delays in processing approval of our XXXX loan modification application. 
XXXX a ) We received a notice from the court that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Series XXXXXXXX had withdrawn the foreclosure action. b ) We filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX because they continued the same pattern of illegal business practices of purposeful delay tactics to make our indebtedness impossible to regain and retain ownership of our home. c ) XXXX notified us by telephone that they had approved our HAMP loan modification. But no forms were sent for signatures. Our calls about the matter were ignored for weeks. But in late XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX notified us that our loan and processing was transferred to a new servicer. This was vitriolic. 
XXXX New servicer XXXX XXXX  XXXX . a ) On contact with XXXX  about our approved HAMP loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX they told us that we had to start over the application process. b ) We filed a first CFPB complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX. They responded that XXXX  reported our application as incomplete and that the HAMP program ended on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  stated that they can only offer us an in-house loan modification program. Again this was clearly a collaborative reaction. c ) But We completed and returned the application to XXXX. ( d ) On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX XXXX  XXXX informing us of impending foreclosure proceedings on behalf of their client, XXXX. ( XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX we filed a second CFPB complaint against XXXX  and XXXX because it was clear that they were determined to use fraudulent and illegal means to forcefully rob us of our home. ( f ) In late XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called from XXXX XXXX  XXXX about approval of a loan modification with a trial date of XXXX. But he added that we must pay {$10000.00} to begin the trial period. What ensued was a high volume response from me telling him that his company is attempting to extort money illegally from us, and our intent is to file another CFPB complaint. He quickly got off the telephone and returned soon after with perfuse apologies that he was mistakenly looking at another clients file. 
XXXX a ) We accepted the loan modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX with a written statement that we adamantly deny owing the fraudulent loan balance of {$720000.00}. 27 and we were accepting it under duress. b ) We were convinced that had we rejected it, XXXX would sell our property to a predatory investor for a fraction of what they were demanding from us. During this period It was routine for cars to stop in front of our home and look until we came out our cell phones in hand. We firmly believed then and now that the {$10000.00} demand and enormous loan balance were calculated to force us to reject the loan offer and abandon our home. c ) We contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke XXXX XXXX about our concerns with the loan and followed up with a letter as well as emails to the XXXX Loss Mitigation and Escalation departments. d ) We asked for a 90-day grace period to appeal the XXXX standard loan modification. XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with a letter stating that our loan was owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX for XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Pass-Through Certificates, Series XXXX and ignored our requests. 
XXXX New servicer Bank of America XXXX This was our second and now current involvement with this bank. ( a ) They charged us {$8500.00} for lender placed hazard insurance on XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted BOA by on-line message to point out the major discrepancy with their price and that of the prior servicer, XXXX XXXX  XXXX  who purchased the LPI for the period XXXX period at {$3700.00}, making Bank of Americas cost over 200 % more. Bank of America stated that it was due to LPI coverage calculated on the loan balance of {$710000.00}. b ) We pointed out that XXXX XXXX  XXXX documented that the LPI was based on the current appraised home value not on the loan balance. We got no response but later noticed a refund of {$8500.00} on the account, and since then the LPI costs are under {$4000.00}. ( b ) In XXXX we filed a CFPB complaint for Bank of America to extend access to a COVID-19 loan deferral program to us. This was done. 
Conclusion : Below are the main damages sustained in our fight for justice and to retain our home. 1 ) Intense emotional and mental stress. Writing tens of letters, and making numerous phone calls with no response, as well as filing complaints are very distressing mentally and emotionally. 2 ) Severe financial damage and losses : - This mainly applies to the fraudulent and illegal 52-year loan balance of {$720000.00}, with yearly increasing interest rates. But it also includes the significant costs of almost {$70000.00} we incurred for the legal and business services we used in our struggle to obtain a loan modification and preserve ownership of our home. 3 ) Currently, there is no path for us to access equity in our home or to sell it for a profit due to the colossal mortgage balance. Therefore at XXXX XXXX XXXX and still in grief for my husband who passed away on XX/XX/XXXX, this situation with our home is ominous, but for Gods presence in my life. This severe injustice put the dream of passing on our home free and clear to our sons at risk, unless circumstances change. 4 ) Devastation of our credit : - Even if I wanted to accept a reverse mortgage on my home, I do not qualify for obvious reasons. Yet we remain confident that we will be vindicated and receive justice, whether it comes from a judge in a court of law or by the power of Almighty God.",Mortgage modification,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",FL,33617,Older American,Consent provided,Web,6/10/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,5657129

They applied incorrectly to a escrow account and Ive been trying to get this fixed ever since. This entire year they have not been able to apply the funds correctly or refund me the money. In XXXX of this year I paid it again because they were now reporting me to the credit bureaus even though payments were made. Now I received a corrected XXXX tax statement.

35,5/28/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX retired XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX. In my XXXX XXXX working within the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, whether in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX facing with many difficult problems and decisions, I had not run across the level of denial or ignorance that I have observed within the Bank of America system . Refusing to accept responsibilities, accountability; refusing to admit wrong doing, deliberately covering up facts and mistakes. A person or an institution not willing to admit wrongs, would not recognize those wrongs, therefore will not see a need to make corrections. 

In the last comment stated in the response on XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX XXXX, we realized that you may not be pleased with our final resolution and Bank of America considers the matter closed and will no longer respond to further inquiries ; clearing telling me and the rest of the world that Bank of America does not want to answer any pertinent questions honestly and in detail, does not want to resolve the issues, just want to sweep this mater under the rug and not wanting to deal with them. If there was a final resolution as stated, please share with me what was this final resolution from Bank of America? 

Shortly after the fire was put out by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, my home insurance XXXX issued me a check in the amount of {$170000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX as an initial payment for restoring our home. I deposited this check into my BofA account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I was not told or received any explanation that the check is being handled differently than any other checks. After XXXX months not seeing this amount available I started calling BofA to find out what happen to my fund supposed to be available for me to pay the contractor. I finally received funding in my account ( XXXX and a half months later ), but only {$57000.00} was released to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I called BofAs Property claims for an explanation. I was told that because there were dishonest contractors out there who failed to perform as expected, BofA has to closely monitor how funding is released by ordering periodic home inspection, review the report closely and carefully, authenticate the written report with the accompanied photos that the percentage of job completion is accurate before disbursing the fund. Bank of America failed to accomplish that process. 

If BofA had reviewed the XX/XX/XXXX report closely along with the photos, the 60 % job completion failed to support the amount of work done in accordance with the photos taken by the inspector. Why was that not caught the eyes of the BofA personnel who were responsibility in reviewing the report? Past experience that BofA has with the possibility of dishonest contractors doing less work and receiving more pay from its customers has driven BofA to initiate a procedure to closely and carefully review home inspection report for job progress before funding release. BofA has internal guidelines and SOP that their personnel has to follow to insure the effectiveness of this program and to prevent mishaps. Your personnel had done their part to withhold insurance disbursed funds ; they had also done their part to order the home inspection reports. BofA personnel had failed to properly review and authenticate the reports for validity and accuracy. If this last step was done when the XX/XX/XXXX inspection report was received ; the percentage of job completion was only 30 % and not 60 % ; and the second payment of {$46000.00} should not have released on XX/XX/XXXX. This system of check and balanced has not included the homeowners ( who know their home ) or the insurance company who pay for the home restoration, only BofA has this report and not diligently managed or processed them. ( see attached faulty XXXX inspection report ) Unreasonably closing a case by not giving a satisfactory explanation would not solve a problem, if Bank of America still think that it is not liable for the insurance fund mismanagement action, give me a satisfactory explanation ( 1 ) why you are not liable for failing to follow your own process? ( 2 ) Why disbursing more fund than work done creating an opportunity for abuse by dishonest contractors is not your liability? ( 3 ) why failing to review the inspection reports closely and carefully is not your responsibility? ( 4 ) Why even bother to order for home inspection if you are not going to read the content carefully before disbursing fund? Please answer all points by the number, and again do not give schoolbook answers that every one already know. I would not be asking those question if you are following your procedures by the book. 

In the past XXXX complaints I filed, BofA had totally ignored or to address this process is not being followed, recklessly issued my fund and blatantly blaming me for my action. Please address your home inspection process how you exercise your review and authenticate those reports as accurate leading to appropriate funding release. Again, please do not give me schoolbook answers as you did in the past. I want to know what your Property Claim personnel really did with those reports and why they had missed such critical errors I had filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for fabricating and falsified home inspection reports ( see attached falsified reports ). XXXX is contracted by Bank of America and BofA is totally responsible for its action for the deliberate delivery of falsified home inspection reports, and BofA acted upon their results in releasing fund to me. If BofAs verifying process not including the homeowner when those reports become available, then BofAs system is flawed, and a flawed system resulting in harm done to BofA customers, BofA is still liable for the damage and must compensate for its mistakes. Bank of America is holding my insurance fund and not diligently managing that fund, Bank of America is liable for the mis- management of that fund leading to more money release than work done. 

Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX are the professionals who have the knowledge of the definition of percentage of job completion and details how the percentage arrives. A lay person like myself is lacking that knowledge, and thats the reason I have to rely on them to assure the amount of work done by the XXXX is accurately assessed. Misinterpreting that value leading to wrong judgment is the liability of Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX. A mistake is unintentional, a misguided act ; but an intentional misdirection is more than a mistake.

39,5/18/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Good afternoon, I am writing you in hopes you can be of assistance in correcting this misuse of HAF funds by Bank of America.

My Mortgage Servicer Bank of America requested, received and applied my HAF California Mortgage Relief funds incorrectly.

Per Californias HAF program Plan submitted to the U.S. Treasury for approval the goal of this program is to bring California Homeowners mortgage 's to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status. Unfortunately that is not what happened.

I was approved for the California HAF program under the California Mortgage Relief Program. However, the funds requested by me to bring my Mortgage to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status {$24000.00} as of XX/XX/2022 had been changed to {$9800.00} by a representative of the California Mortgage Relief Program per my loan servicer BofA.

I had contacted both BofA and the CA Mortgage Relief Program numerous times to inform them of how important it was to have the correct amount funded to fully reinstate my mortgage to Current as my home was and is now again in a forclouser status.

However, I was not contacted back byeither party prior to funds being paid to BofA by the CA Mortgage Relief Program in the amount of {$9800.00} which was intended to bring my Mortgage to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status per the "" Congratulations on your approval, funding and funds being applied by your loan servicer to bring your mortgage to a fully reinstated Current status '' email I received from the California Mortgage Relief Program ( which it did not ).

My loan servicer Bank of America did not apply the total amount of funds recieved {$9800.00} to my principal balance as intended by California 's Mortgage Relief program.

Funds where applied : Principal Balance : {$7000.00} Interest : {$1900.00} Escrow : {$390.00} And held in Unapplied funds account : {$520.00}.

I believe this to be an intentional misuse of Federal Covid-19 CARES Act grant funds by Bank of America . I believe this intentional misuse of funds was committed by Bank of America so they could continue to proceed with the forclouser sale of my home. I believe that Bank of America did this against the intended purpose of the HAF program so they could profit off of the funds received from the California Mortgage Relief Program and then double dip into all the additional funds they will receive on the forclouser sale. I believe Bank of America Intentionally misinformed the CA Mortgage Relief Program of the amount needed to bring my mortgage current and then intentionaly misused those funds intended to bring my home to a fully reinstated "" Current '' status.

Remove the late charge effective XXXX and any other late charges issued since then. 
Confirm in writing that the remaining payments due are the same as those in the original amortization schedule, and send the numeric values of those payment amounts in writing. 


You already have background information on this issue from notes from the multiple phone calls and emails I have made to Bank of America, but I will recap here : At around XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I accidentally scheduled a manual payment for the amount due XXXX from XXXX in addition to the automatic payments we had set up from XXXX XXXX Then, after learning from my wife that we had automatic payments set up from our XXXX checking account, I canceled the manual payment around XXXX minutes later, at around XXXX XXXX XXXX Apparently your website mishandled the cancellation request, because that payment went through, then the automatic payment went through on XXXX. 

I tried to get the extra payment refunded by Bank of America through a phone call where I received the case code XXXX. The representative said that it could take up to 45 business days, but that amount of time passed with no updates to me or my account. 

I also wrote to XXXX on XXXX and again on XXXX after XXXX business days had passed but received no response. 

Eventually I asked XXXX to cancel the extra payment from their side, which they did. 

When doing my 2021 taxes on XXXX I realized that the 1098 from Bank of America had the wrong amount listed for Total Interest Paid in XXXX, {$27000.00} instead of {$33000.00}.

From XXXX till now, 53 days had gone by, with 35 emails encounters. The primary individuals from BofA I had communicated with were XXXX XXXX, BofA Regulatory Complaints, and XXXX XXXX, Property Claims. Very unfortunate that those issues were never resolved through those two individuals To be specific, XXXX XXXX, who had used avoidance not to answer questions that I posted to him, not providing email for a more efficient way to communicate, deliberately delay in answering emails or calls by constantly making excuses from very busy, to not receiving my emails ( when they were confirmed received ) ; creating confusion by pretence that he did not recognize an individual when that person had been in contact with him several times. 

The Response from BofA through XXXX XXXX was filled with lies to mask underlying issues BofA has with me, a great 40 % to 50 % of the Response content was addressing funds issued by BofA, fund disbursed to me instead of addressing how they neglect reviewing the reports closely, knowing the content of the reports were incorrect and still releasing funds to the scrupulous contractors. 

I realize money being scammed by dishonest contractors is not a responsibility of BofA, but promoting inefficient check and balance in the reviewing of those Insurance Loss Inspection report process, and creating an opportunity for those scrupulous contractor to scam bank customer is what BofA must be responsible for. In accordance with the Bank of Americas ( BofA ) three pages Claim Notice Procedure sent on XX/XX/XXXX ; on page 2, bottom paragraph, under Step 4 : Schedule an Inspection ; Inspections are required throughout the claim process to validate repairs are progressing and to support release of additional claim funds and Step XXXX : Received additional payments from us : Once we review the inspection results, we will issue a subsequent disbursement. 

How I spend the funds, and who to spend it on is my responsibility, trusting BofA to exercising full judgment whether to release or not release that money through the validation and accuracy in those reports is the responsibility of BofA and its subcontractor XXXX XXXX XXXX. Had BofA reviewed the XX/XX/XXXX inspection reports properly, and going through the procedure to validate work completed against accompanied photos, it would have failed to validate, and the 60 % job completion was also not supported. BofA should never had release the second disbursement, and yet BofA approved of a second funding release.

52,3/23/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"To whom it may concern, I currently have a mortgage held by Bank of America with a payment plan under the modification program with an interest rate of 4.5 %. Through the entire pandemic I did not miss one single payment or was late with one payment. Last year I received a letter from Bank of America stating that my escrow account didnt have enough funds in it and that Bank of America was going to start taking out a little extra each month to repay the escrow which is short. When I called Bank of America and inquired about this and I informed them that I did not miss one single payment my question was how can my escrow account be short? I was told several different responses as to my taxes had gone up my insurance had gone up or I had missed a payment. I do not see my taxes went up enough to make my escrow short by almost {$5000.00}. When I asked them about the payment plan that they have in place to replenish the escrow my question was am I paying interest on this money thats being repaid? I was not given a definite answer and I also request to speak to somebody who would know exactly what was going on. I do not understand how they can go ahead and not make the proper payments that were necessary as far as principal, interest, escrow. Ive already had a difficult time with Bank of America back in 2010 when they put me into a modification program that I never authorized and started taking out extra money per month to cover the escrow which was not in my budget. 
So my complaint to you is Bank of America charging me interest on this extra time that theyre giving me to replenish my escrow? If so then why should I go ahead and pay interest on top of interest then Ive already paid. Its bad enough that they wouldnt help me refinance my house a couple months ago due to the fact that my income was down because of the previous year with a pandemic. As I stated I did not miss any payments during that time, my credit rating is XXXX, and I have enough money in the bank and in mutual funds that can be accessible if needed. I do not trust Bank of America. Too big to fail to big the jail my XXXX.

68,1/6/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Complaint Overview : Unapplied Funds account mysteriously arises in XXXX XXXX. I am missing a mortgage payment, as in bank has wrongly credited my account. The Bank keeps making excuses as to how this happened and has yet to correct the issue, I am under the impression the bank misappropriated one of my monthly mortgage payments.

Detailed Complaint of Horrendous Customer Service : OnXX/XX/ I received a letter from Bank of America stating that they had not received my home loan payment of {$830.00} for said month. This was instantly a red flag, since not only had I made my payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX of {$830.00}, but every single month prior to this I have paid promptly at the beginning of each respective month.

I walked into the local branch bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX  with my XXXX XXXX receipt in hand seeking answers. I was not given any. The branch managers could only certify that my payment was indeed processed correctly to the proper mortgage account & next they connected me with the bank 's mortgage department customer service line. The mortgage customer service representative began to state that the payment of XXXXXXXX XXXX was missing, I showed my receipt of that month to the branch manager who then gave the "" transaction code number '' to the customer service rep over the phone. Then the customer service rep stated payment of XXXX XXXX was missing although the branch manager confirmed the payment had been made in person on time, I showed that receipt, then the agent insisted XXXXXXXX XXXX was missing, I showed that receipt as well, no answer, customer service rep was confused. I have to add it was painstaking getting a Mortgage Customer Service rep on the phone and every single agent I spoke to spewed conflicting information.

The branch manager told me in confidence that this has been a common problem as of recent with mortgage customers, he began to explain that one of the bank 's computer programs was not registering payments while another computer program was and that along with all the newly hired staff over the pandemic it had lead to a huge mishap on the Bank 's end. The process was so frustrating that the bank managers even grew tired of dealing with the mortgage customer service reps as they continued to spew contradictory information, after many frustrating calls to the mortgage department directly from the branch manager 's office, a case was finally opened to supposedly resolve my payment disputes and look into missing payments of XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX. I call back a week later, only to find out that only one of those payments have been corrected, the payment on XXXX XXXX XXXX1, although I had sent them proof of both payments. Then the mortgage rep says that this whole ordeal began in XXXX XXXX, where there is now a missing payment. I was flabbergasted as that is almost a year ago, scared that I would not be able to find my receipt, to my luck I found that receipt but this is frankly ridiculous. Every single time I call, a new rep in the mortgage department seems to invent a new missing payment although the local bank branch processed all of my payments correctly and luckily I have all the receipts. Still to this day, the bank has not explained to me what is going on, even after I noticed in my September Bank statement that my money appeared in an "" Unapplied Funds '' account and it seems the bank misappropriated my monthly payments and frankly I do not know where they placed my money. I noticed all these odd credits and reversals on behalf of the bank labeled "" Unapplied Funds '' and "" Misapplication reversal '' and "" Principal Curtailment '' on the dates ofXX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/,XX/XX/, and XX/XX/XXXX You can see all these credits on my bank statement dated XX/XX/. To add injury to insult, I have suspicion that they may have misappropriated one of my monthly home loan payments into the Escrow account as it seems to be a bit larger than usual, especially since taxes were paid this month, XXXXXXXX XXXX. The last mortgage customer service rep I spoke to agreed that I may be correct but gave me no definitive answer and just told me that the "" pay transaction specialists '' are going to input the latest receipt of XXXXXXXX XXXX. I grew so frustrated that I faxed over all of my receipts from the year XXXX, including a payment from XXXX XXXX. It seems so preposterous that the bank is unable to keep track of my payments that were done in person at their local branch.

One important detail I forgot to add was that every single time they claimed they had found a missing payment, they swore it was due to a bounced check. Bounced check in XXXX XXXX, bounced check in XXXX XXXX, and lastly bounced check in XXXX XXXX, is what they claimed. I replied to them that this was impossible as I never pay them in check and my account has never been back charged, the local branch bank managers backed up my statements as they looked at the physical receipts of the payments processed in person.

Lastly, I would like to add that in a Statement datedXX/XX/XXXX from the Bank in small print it states I am 165 days delinquent on my mortgage and on that same statement there is a list of the previous 6 months balances showing that the balance has been FULLY PAID onXX/XX/XXXX and every month after that shows an UNPAID BALANCE DUE of {$0.00} this is contradictory. This is the sort of complaint the brank manager made me privy to ; mortgage customers were wrongly receiving delinquency notices on payments they had indeed made.",Mortgage/ payments,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,90255,NA,Consent provided,Web,1/6/2022,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,5076596

I recently applied to the Homeowners Assistance program via a link found on Bank of America website in which directly connects you to the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Program. Each state has a federally approved housing organization that administers the program funds and works directly with the Lender of the default borrower. 

On XX/XX/2021, I received an updated status notification stating that my application was withdrawn due to no response from the lender. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Both XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and Bank of America for additional information regarding my mortgage assistance application. I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX that Bank of America has refused to allow their borrowers an opportunity to participate in this program, and that XXXX could not proceed unless the lender sign a service participation program agreement, which has been previously submitted to BOA by XXXX. XXXX XXXX also stated that she has been directed by her BOA mortgage contact that BOA has decided to place all of its borrowers that are participating in the home owners Assistance program on hold. 

Upon receiving this information, I was in total shock because I assumed that BOA would be on board with helping distress borrowers bring their mortgage current, especially when BOA benefits as well. I also do not understand why BOA would advertise a program on their site for assistance, but in the end prevent borrowers from accessing the funds by refusing to work with affiliated organizations administering the homeowners assistance program. 

Next, I reached out to Bank of America customer service department to validate XXXX claim and to check on the status of my application, however I have not received any feedback other than I needed to contact XXXX for enrollment purposes, and to answer any questions regarding the Homeowners assistance program. In addition, the BOA representative could not direct me to anyone within BOA company that could assist me further. 

With that said, I am reaching out to your office hoping that you will assist me in resolving this matter and allow me an opportunity to participate in the homeowners assistance program. Please be advised that XXXX has stated to me that time is of the essence and the program will exist until dollars run out. Thanks in advance for your assistance in helping to bring more clarity in this matter and hopefully access to federal dollars to prevent default on my current BOA mortgage.

However, despite our repeated attempts to communicate with XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the terms of our mortgage going forward, we have yet to be given documentation regarding our mortgage in the post-forbearance period or confirmation that the missed payments will be moved into a deferred balance to be fully due upon the loan 's maturity date ( which we believe we are qualified to receive and in fact did receive that offer in XXXX of XXXX but decided to take an offer of XXXX more months forbearance that was offered at the same time ). We were also recently notified that, effective XX/XX/XXXX, our loan will be serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and neither XXXX XXXX XXXX  nor XXXX XXXX XXXX have told us the amount of the payment we are required to make on XX/XX/XXXX and what our loan/deferral terms will be going forward. We are very concerned about our loan slipping through the cracks, especially given the upcoming transition of the loan to a new servicer. We want to do everything we can to have the mortgage/deferral terms finalized by XX/XX/XXXX so we can move forward with certainty and make the appropriate payments. 

I have made hundreds of phone calls to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and received misinformation from their representatives repeatedly. I have an entire narrative that lists the names and dates of representatives to whom I have spoken. ( Sometimes they refuse to give their full name ) I am in the process of updating that document to reflect the last conversations I have had with the Bank. It is difficult to create because initially I was told that my request for a Deferral would be honored. I simply needed to "" Opt Out '' of the offer they had made initially. I have been calling at least XXXX a week if not daily since XX/XX/XXXX. I now keep a notebook and try to record the full name of the representative, the date, time and, the number I have called. I generally do not speak to the same person XXXX  in a row and receive conflicting information depending on who answers. I have complied with every request made of me and have made payments that should take me through the end of XXXX. I have been asking for a single point of contact on this important issue since early XXXX, but that request has been refused. I will gladly supply that document once it is updated and would be more than happy for you to publish it. XXXX XXXX XXXX is being nearly impossible to work with. This situation is affecting both I am my wife 's work, health and, mental state. We are devastated that XXXX XXXX XXXX would behave in this manner. 

We were instructed and allowed to "" Opt Out '' of the loan structure they were proposing, and we were notified that we had successfully completed our "" Trial Payment '' period. We were congratulated on being out of forbearance. However, we have recently learned, not in writing but via a phone call yesterday, XXXX with one of their representatives that that though we did not request further forbearance and were told that we were no longer in forbearance, our account is now listed as being back in forbearance. This is preventing us from seeking to refinance with a local company at a lower interest rate. For this reason, I believe it would be fair to ask that they substantially lower the interest rate on the "" Deferral Agreement '' when and if it is ever completed and sent to us, as interest rates are at an all-time low and the point of forbearance was to keep people in their homes and make housing more affordable. I was also told in May by their representative, that when I came out of forbearance the interest rate would be lowered and that part of the principal might be forgiven. None of that has been the case, so I would urge anyone who is dealing with XXXX to get all information of this type in writing.

During Covid-19 Pandemic, I requested and was given a total of 18 months of mortgage payment deferment by the bank ( XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX ). However when I resumed paying my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX after the 18 months were completed, I noticed that the deferred amount shown on my mortgage statement is less than 18 months worth of mortgage payments. From my calculations, it appeared that they have kept the principal portion of those deferred mortgage payments in the original principal balance, and have only deferred the interest portions. I have contacted the bank several times, and have either been told to just wait, have been hung up on, or generally got the runaround with no clear answer or responsibility. I am ready to give up pursuing an answer from them and that is why I have contacted you. 

I want to emphasize that if this is not an error that will eventually be corrected, this action by the bank is very inappropriate and against what was promised to customers by the bank when customers requested mortgage deferments, and extended it as allowed by law for up to 18 months. The letters sent by the bank confirming every 3-month deferment period stated that the "" mortgage payments '' will be deferred and not just the "" mortgage interest payments ''. 

Please bring this to the attention of appropriate mortgage department managers at Bank of America so it can be corrected for all customers, as it is wrong, immoral, and may even be illegal for the bank to do this cunning maneuver so that they can charge customers additional interest on principal amounts that have already accrued interest and should have subsequently been placed in the deferred category.",Mortgage/ forbearance,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",CA,90024,NA,Consent provided,Web,11/14/2021,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,4910052

Previous complaints have been filed in XXXX ( Ref # XXXX ), XXXX ( Ref # XXXX ). 

My mortgage payments are not being processed IAW Bank of America 's policy and federal guidelines. My mortgage is currently paid 12 months in advance ( including advance interest ) and the next payment due date is XX/XX/XXXX. This has not been requested by me, and I have made numerous phone calls, and emails to have this corrected to no avail since XXXX. 

My last phone call to BoA was on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX w/ XXXX when I informed BoA that my mortgage was paid thru XX/XX/XXXX, and that the payments were not being properly applied. I had previous called on XX/XX/XXXX in effort to correct this- she was able to see notes referring to this call and my request. She said she would research this and correct it. It was not corrected, and there was no follow up. 

I have written correspondence to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, BoA managers, who responded to CFPB complaint XXXX. They initially corrected the issue, and then explained via telephone that their system was unable to process the payments. I have a recording of this phone call. The following is a transcript of the email : -- "" XXXX, Thank you for the prompt response to my formal complaint to the CFPB. Per our conversation today there should not be any ambiguity as to what the issue is and what my desires for resolution are : 1. Correct all mid-month payments to principal only ( latest errors date to XX/XX/XXXX ). 

2. Ensure all future mid month payments are treated as principal only payments. 

I began making a record of calls regarding this issue to Bank of America as far back as XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Although the issue dates back to XX/XX/XXXX based on my mortgage statements and notes. During the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX call, XXXX made an annotation on the account to prevent this from happening in the future. XXXX ( supervisor ) informed me that it is not possible to pay more than 30 days ahead per regulations under the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ). She further stated that "" We had a lot of problems where a lot of customers were paying in advance but not seeing the principal go down. '' When I asked her how I could ensure that my mid month payments in the future would be designated principal only her response was, "" honestly, I don't know. '' A subsequent conversation with XXXX XXXX- ( BoA Supervisor, XXXX XXXX ) also ensured that notes on the account stated "" Customer desires all payments on the XXXX to be posted to principal. '' There were similar conversations on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, etc, etc. Please review all of your records to see the numerous phone calls, most escalated to a supervisor, who all are on your recorded line telling me that excess payments will be applied to principal. 

The most recent supervisor was XXXX XXXX supervisor Customer Service Mortgages, XXXX, FL, who suggested making the payments on the XXXX or the end of the month. When I asked if that would fix the issue and ensure that the payments would be applied to principal his response was, "" you never know. '' XXXX, these responses from BoA employees and supervisors are completely unacceptable. The lack of professionalism and numerous violations of stated BoA policy and federal regulations in the application of my mortgage payments despite my pleas to the contrary ; rises to the level of malfeasance. 

It is my sincere hope that you and your staff will be able to resolve this issue and ensure that future payments to Bank of America are correctly applied in accordance with BoA written policy, and all state and federal regulations. Any further misapplied payments will result in my escalation of this issue to the appropriate authorities and legal remedy. 

Thanks for your time and consideration. 

Respectfully, XXXX XXXX '' -- - This is the third CFPB complaint regarding BoA 's reluctance to correctly apply mortgage payments IAW policy and federal regulations. I want my mortgage payments correctly applied, all pre-paid interest placed towards principal, all unapplied funds applied to principal, corrected tax records for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and a correct XXXX.

17,11/9/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"**NOTE : THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE REQUEST. IT CAN NOT BE DUPLICATE BECAUSE IT RELATES TO AN OCC CONSENT ORDER THAT WAS ISSUED IN XXXX RESULTING IN A CHECK THAT WAS ONLY JUST RECEIVED IN THE PAST FEW DAYS. XXXX Citibank recently issued a check with no explanation. My understanding is that this check was issued by Citibank pursuant to OCC Consent Order # XXXX ( the Consent Order ) relating to Citibanks failure to properly administer a relationship discount pricing program. 

I would like to raise the following two concerns for the CFPBs consideration and information : 1. The check issued to me by CitiMortgage provides insufficient compensation for Citis failure to discount the mortgage interest rate to the correct RLP discounted rate ( as required pursuant to the Consent Order. Citi has verbally indicated that the discount that Citi should have extended to me in XXXX would have reduced the interest rate by 25 basis points and that pursuant to its agreement with the OCC that Citi is apparently only required to make an interest rate adjustment for a period of 5 years ( even though my mortgage is a 30 year mortgage ). Citis calculation for its remediation check is limited to interest only and does not reflect the additional amortization that would have occurred if the rate had been adjusted to the rate that they claim should have applied. Nor does it reflect the time value of money. In short, Citibanks interest saved calculation is wrong, Citibank makes no adjustment for the increased amortization that should have occurred, and Citibank makes no adjustment for the smaller overall monthly payment that should have been due every month pursuant to a reduced mortgage rate that would have saved thousands of dollars to date. In paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the Consent Order, the OCC notes  that Citibank has instituted a plan to reimburse all customers who did not receive the appropriate RLP benefit and is taking appropriate remedial actions to fully address and correct the violations of law ( emphasis added ). However, Citibank has not complied with the order to fully compensate and fully address its failure to extend relationship pricing to me.

2. In the Consent Order, OCC noted that Citibank failed to provide adequate training to loan officers regarding how to offer RLP to Bank customers and that because of ineffective risk management and control weaknesses, certain Bank borrowers did not receive the RLP benefit for which they were eligible. I would like to bring to OCCs attention Citibanks remarkably similar failure to properly administer its rate reduction program which was offered to me in XX/XX/XXXX. Under this program, Citibank offered to allow borrowers to benefit from a one-time rate reduction opportunity if certain conditions were met. Our loan officer sent us a flyer about the program and confirmed that our mortgage benefited from this rate reduction feature. However, after the mortgage was issued, when I subsequently contacted Citi to take advantage of the feature, Citi indicated to me that the feature had not been included in my mortgage because the Citi loan officer did not fill out the appropriate paperwork for inclusion of the feature. Despite sharing with Citi written communications from our loan officer, Citi has steadfastly refused to honor the feature, which would have resulted in a reduction in our monthly mortgage for several years to date and the remaining 20-plus years of the life of the mortgage. Citi was not moved by my argument that it would be vicariously liable for any missteps of its loan officer and that Citi would be required by law to honor its loan officers representations. Much like the OCCs findings set forth  in the Consent Order, the loan officers written representations state that Citi provided inadequate training in connection with Citis new product offerings ; that he had no idea that he needed to fill in any paperwork as he believed the feature automatically applied to all loans ; that he represented to me that the feature was included in my mortgage ; and the he believed under the circumstances Citi should honor the feature. Furthermore, I note that Citibank also indicated that, contrary to the information provided by Citis loan officer, my loan apparently did not qualify for the program because ( according to Citi ) only primary residence mortgages qualified for the program. However, even this response seems flawed because ( 1 ) it ignores the verified representations of Citis loan officer and ( 2 ) the terms and conditions of the policy per the flyer offering the program ( see attached ) do not state that the program only applies to primary residences : it states that offer applies to new home mortgage applications which is what my  mortgage was.",Undecipherable,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,90004,NA,Consent provided,Web,11/9/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3433468

Loan was based on our primer status with Citibank. Since we had over {$500000.00} with Citibank, we were promised 1/8 point discount on the loan. When we were on final stages of loan preparation, we were told that since we are using part of the {$500000.00} for down payment, we were not eligible for 1/8 point discount. At that point we did not have any other options and we reluctantly closed the loan. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a check for {$4000.00} from Citibank mortgage without any explanations. As I dug into the issue, I discovered that this check was for the 1/8 point overcharge based on a XXXX XXXX dollar settlement Citibank had CFPB. The {$4000.00} check, based on the person responded to my calls with Citibank, is for the rate difference. Citibank told me that they have calculated the difference in interest for 5 years and made some deductions that is how they have arrived to {$4000.00}. I argued with the Citibank representative that this not acceptable. They need to either pay me the difference in monthly payment between 3.25 % and 3.125 %, which is equal to {$73.00} per month, for as long as I hold the loan and bring the back payments in to today 's dollar value.

23,4/22/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"My problem involves three ( 3 ) separate financial institutions : Citimortgage, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX that have seemingly inadvertently, and yet nonetheless harmfully, prejudiced my financial well-being, my credit status, and my good name. 

I feel that at this point I have exhausted the avenues of resolution dictated by policies of each of the three involved financial institutions individually. 

A significant part of the problem would appear to be that the respective institutions do appear not talk to one another. 

Each has advised me to seek satisfaction from the other when the most cursory analysis of the issue reveals that it has been the handoffs of my account between the institutions wherein the major problems lie. 

More specifically : erroneous information about the status my account and its prior servicing by Citimortgage much of which servicing deviated radically from accepted practices has been passed between the involved institutions, making my good faith attempts set the record straight a XXXX nightmare of buck-passing between the institutions. 

It is only after weeks of silence and unresponsiveness on the part of the respective institutions that, on advice of counsel, I now solicit assistance at a higher level. 

In brief, the problem arose when Citimortgage purported to sell my mortgage account to a new servicer, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX of XXXX without properly noticing me. ( The mortgage account was subsequently transferred to XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. ) Even without proper notice from Citimortgage, the magnitude of the ensuing problems should never have been allowed to grow to the extent it did had Citimortgage simply adhered to its own stated policies not to mention the most fundamental, commonsensical bookkeeping practices. 

Unfortunately, Citimortgage has acted in an inexplicable and irregular manner with respect to both the servicing, and the putative transfer of my loan to the successor servicer ( XXXX XXXX ). 

By stonewalling me in my earnest efforts to resolve the problem amicably ( and by its own prescribed problem-resolution procedures ) Citimortgage is exponentially compounding its malfeasance. 

Text of relevant correspondence between myself and Citimortgage and the successor loan servicer ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX ) is supplied below. It constitutes an accurate, blow-by-blow, recapitulation of the basic circumstances of my case. 

My respectful request to the CFPB is to intercede with the relevant financial institutions ( Citimortrgage, XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) in a manner as to effect the prompt return to me of : 1. {$16000.00}, plus or minus the amount Citimorrtgage erroneously represented to XXXX XXXX as the total of my purported "" delinquent payments '', and that XXXX subsequently demanded of me to prevent my property from going into foreclosure ; 2. {$4900.00} for "" forced insurance '' erroneously charged to me by XXXX XXXX, owing to Citmortgage 's failure to provide relevant information to the successor loan servicer about preexisting insurance on my property. 

CASE SYNOPSIS : Re : CitiMortgage ( Citi ) irregular bookkeeping practices re : my loan # XXX XXXX. The occasion of this written communication is the stonewalling by Citi customer services of my good faith efforts to seek clarification of its actions in reference to its history of servicing the above-referenced loan actions that have caused me financial and emotional duress, as well as prejudiced my credit standing and good name. 

2. In my ( recorded ) telephone call with XXXX in Citi customer services on XXXX, I was advised that my account with CitiMortgage was now closed ( and in fact had been "" closed '' since XXXX of XXXX ) and that communications with Citi seeking said clarification of its actions with regard to its servicing the loan, as well as the return to me of over twenty ( 20 ) months of installment payments ( totaling in excess of {$16000.00} ) improperly accepted by Citi, would perforce need to be addressed in writing to its legal department and that no one could help me on the phone. 

3. This unfriendly and dismissive posture on Citis part was bewildering to me inasmuch as review of my financial records for the past two years revealed that Citi had accepted, without fail, automatic installment payments of {$1600.00} each month for the entire interval, and was continuing to do so at the present time and indeed continued to do so until I canceled the automatic payments this month ( XX/XX/XXXX ). In all, Citi accepted twenty-six ( 26 ) monthly payments of {$1600.00} each after it had purportedly closed out my account. 

4. XXXX represented that my loan had been transferred to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, and that I should have known of this fact via a so-called Good-bye letter purportedly sent by CITI via USPS to the address of the property ( where I no longer resided ). 

5. It was, and is, the height of hypocrisy on Citis part to purport that I should have known that the loan had been transferred to another servicer when Citi itself wasnt aware that it had transferred the loan : why else would Citi continue accept automatic payments for 26 months after the purported transfer in violation of its own stated policy that it may do so for a maximum of three ( 3 ) months ( and is obligated to convey any such additional payments received to the new mortgage servicer )? 

6. I have consulted with multiple financial experts ( and my attorney ) regarding Citis behavior in this matter. Among the comments I have received to date are : Citi should have noticed you of the transfer by certified mail. Citi should have emailed you. This is unprecedented. This is inexplicable. Its bizarre. I dont see how it was not overseen and stopped. Ive never seen anything like it in my life. 

7. My position is that Citi must immediately : A. Provide a prompt and transparent history of all transactions it has undertaken with respect to the servicing of this loan during the past twenty-six months : via a thorough, blow-by-blow written accounting of what funds Citi has accepted from me, what funds Citi has conveyed to the successor loan servicer, the reasons Citi conveyed funds to the new loan servicer for many months beyond its own 3-month grace period, the reasons Citi abruptly stopped conveying to the successor loan servicer substantial funds it continued to accept from me, the reasons Citi continued to convey someof the funds it continued to accept from me to the successor loan servicer ( as tax deposits ), the reasons Citi failed to notice me by certified mail ( or email or both ) of its purported transfer of my account for over two yearsafter it should have been aware of irregularities in its servicing of the loan, and the reasons Citi represents my account as closed when in fact, Citi has been effectively servicing my account ( through various transactions with both me and the successor loan servicer ) up to the present date. 

B. Immediately restore to me any and all funds Citi has improperly accepted as automatic payments for nearly two years after purportedly transferring the loan to a successor servicer more specifically, any and all funds that Citi did not convey to the successor loan servicer, and that Citi can not show evidence of my accepting as refunds from Citi. 

C. Make me whole again by immediately taking whatever steps may be necessary to unwind and erase any and all adverse credit reporting Citi may have undertaken with regard to its servicing of this loan as well as any and all adverse credit reporting that Citi may be indirectly responsible for by causing any and all successor loan servicers to erroneously believe that I did not continue to make regular monthly payments timely, and in utter good faith, during the entire life of this loan. 

As a courtesy to the Citi legal department I provide, below, a somewhat more detailed chronology of events as I understand them. 

Given Citis present posture of stonewalling my good faith efforts to clear up this unfortunate matter, this chronology is necessarily based on ( 1 ) my own records, and ( 2 ) information provided me as a courtesy by the successor loan servicer, XXXX XXXX. 

I am the owner a property on XXX. 

CITImortgage ( CITI ) was the mortgage servicer for years, and has been a de facto co-servicer of this loan until the present month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at which time I stopped making automatic monthly payments on the loan to Citi. 

To assure no risk of a late loan payment, and to avoid any risk of potential adverse effect of my payment of this loan on my credit rating, I took three precautionary measures : 1. I arranged for monthly automatic payments via my regular bank, XXX Bank ; 2. I arranged to routinely pay in excess ofthe requisite payment of interest + principal ; 3. I arranged to pay the installments a full month in advance, so that in the event of any problem with a payment, a de facto additional grace period of 30 days would automatically kick in. 

In the course of preparing my Income Tax figures for XXXX, some disturbing facts about the history of the servicing of my loan account by CITI came to light matters that I am still trying to unwind and seek satisfaction for. 

Among the facts that came to light in XXXX of this year : CITI purportedly transferred the servicing of my loan account to another servicer, XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. 

CITI engaged in bookkeeping practices, and conveyed information and funds pertaining to my account to the successor servicer XXXX XXXX, in such an irregular manner as to prejudice XXXX XXXX against me erroneously portraying me as a delinquent client, and injuring my credit rating and good name. 

CITIs irregular bookkeeping practices have further caused me financial and emotional hardship by improperly accepting and withholding automatic payments from my regular bank account in a manner as to give the illusion that purportedly overdue payments of over {$16000.00} have accrued necessitating my borrowing said funds on an emergency basis to pay down this totally erroneous arrearage, and to prevent foreclosure proceedings against my property. 

Crucial facts of the case include the following : 1. I have NEVER missed making a monthly mortgage payment or supplemental escrow payment during the life of this mortgage. 

2. Even if CITI purports to have transferred the loan to a successor servicer, the incontrovertible fact remains that CITI has continued to accept automatic payments from my bank account for the entire interval in question : amounting to two years and two months or until I cancelled the automatic payments last week, in XX/XX/XXXX. 

3. For eleven ( 11 ) months from XXXX through XXXX CITI conveyed monthly mortgage payments it accepted through my automatic payment service to the successor mortgage servicer XXXX XXXX in violation of its own stated policy of limiting such conveyance of loan payments to three ( 3 ) months after transfer of the loan to a new servicer. 

4. For eight ( 8 ) ADDITIONAL months AFTER XXXX i.e., from XXXX through XXXX CITI continued to convey funds to XXXX XXXX ( in the amounts of {$140.00}, {$600.00}, and {$1200.00} ) as tax deposits that it clearly derived from my continuing automatic monthly payments. 

5. However, despite continuing to accept my regular monthly automatic payments, and making said tax deposits to XXXX XXXX from XXXX through XXXX, CITI failed to convey my principal + interest payments to XXXX XXXX after XXXX, causing XXXX XXXX to erroneously consider my account delinquent after XXXX. 

6. Thus, for twenty ( 20 ) months AFTER CITI purported to transfer the servicing of my loan to XXXX XXXX, CITI continued to act as a de facto servicer of my loan by continuing to accept monthly mortgage payments from me via automatic payment through my regular bank, and by subsequently conveying all of those funds ( from XXXX through XXXX ), or some of the funds ( from XXXX through XXXX ), to the successor loan servicer. 

7. In fact, CITI continued to accept monthly mortgage payments from me until XX/XX/XXXX, at which time I canceled the automatic payment service in my regular bank. 

8. The illusion that my mortgage was somehow in delinquency occasioned by CITIs irregular bookkeeping practices was subsequently passed on to XXXX XXXX, resulting ultimately in a one-time demand payment in excess of {$16000.00} to bring my account current, and to avoid foreclosure on the property. 

9. Of course that entire sum had ALREADY been drawn down from my regular checking account by XXXX but not properly conveyed to the successor loan servicer. Thus, I was forced to pay over {$16000.00} TWICE to prevent further damage to my credit standing and good name. 

10. CITI has given no explanation of why it drew down over {$16000.00} in monthly payments on my loan that it failed to convey to the successor loan servicer, nor of the disposition of those funds 11. Only in XXXX of this year and only after I begin making inquiries as to my account status with CITI did CITI make any acknowledgement that it had improperly accepted thousands of dollars in automatic payments from me : by sending me the following perplexing advisory via email : We are writing to inform you that your recent request for a refund has been processed, and you will receive your check by mail in 7-10 days. 

At that time, I had no inkling of CITIs irregular bookkeeping practices in servicing of my loan. I had made no request for a refund. Consequently, I had no idea what CITI was referencing in this email to me. 

I received subsequent advisories from CITI in each of the intervening months after XX/XX/XXXX, and checks from CITI returning what now amounts to three {$1600.00} automatic payments improperly accepted by CITI in XXXX. 

Not understanding the provenance of these checks and with CITI customer service advising me that I no longer had an account there ( and hence it could not talk to me ) I did not deposit the checks until upon advice of counsel, in XX/XX/XXXX. 

12. Oddly, despite possessing my email address during the entire duration of its servicing of my loan account, CITI made no effort whatsoever to communicate via email with me prior to the commencement of my investigation into its bookkeeping practices ( in XXXX of this year ). 

13. In the event that CITI purports to have sent advisories on the status of my loan, or refund checks ( purportedly returning automatic monthly installments it improperly accepted in XXXX ), via USPS to the address of the property, I would represent : A. That I was not properly noticed of the transfer of the loan to a successor servicer ; B. That CITI itself was clearly unaware that it had transferred the loan for it continued to act as de facto co-servicer of the loan ( along with XXXX XXXX ) for twenty ( 20 ) months AFTER the purported transfer ; C. That it is incumbent upon CITI to offer incontrovertible proof of my having accepted ( i.e., cashed ) any and all purported refund checks ( totaling in excess of {$16000.00} ) if CITI is to make any claim that it has returned this amount to me, and that it is not currently owing this amount. 

14. I have invariably acted in utter good faith in acquitting my obligations with respect to repayment this loan. ( In fact, I have never missed a single payment, nor had a single late payment. ) 15. Notwithstanding rationalizations and self-exculpatory excuses on the part of any mortgage servicer to the effect that it may have followed industry procedure, the fact remains that it is the arabesque and opaque machinations of the mortgage industry beyond the XXXX of even the consumer with a XXXX XXXX that bear principal responsibility for the tragicomedy of errors in the servicing of my loan, and for the injuries that I have suffered as a direct consequence. 

Re : Refund for erroneous property insurance charges ( "" Forced Insurance '' ) Re : Loan # XXX I have submitted to XXXX XXXX XXXX evidence of property insurance ( secured through my own insurance agent ) on my property to prevent duplicate ( "" forced '' ) insurance in XXXX. 

I have also submitted to XXXX XXXX evidence of prior property insurance on my property, to demonstrate that the property was continuously insured during the entirety of XXXX XXXX XXXX interval of servicing the loan. 

The customer services rep at XXXX XXXX advised me to submit the same to XXXX, along with a cc of my letter to XXXX XXXX disputing prior forced insurance charges by XXXX XXXX totaling {$4900.00} and requesting a prompt refund for those erroneous charges. 

Although XXXX XXXX erroneously charged me those funds, the customer services rep instructed me that it is XXXX 's responsibility to refund them, not XXXX XXXX XXXX inasmuch as XXXX XXXX is "" no longer servicing the loan '', but rather that XXXX is now the loan servicer. 

In my letter to XXXX XXXX, provided hereunder, I point out that CITI seriously mismanaged my account failing to provide XXXX XXXX not only funds it accepted in from me during XXXX XXXX 's interval servicing the loan, but also evidence of the property 's being continuously insured for as long as I have owned it. In fact, the XXXX XXXX customer services rep told me that CITI erroneously provided XXXX XXXX no evidence of the property 's being insured during the entire interval XXXX (! ) Text of letter to XXXX XXXX : Re : Refund of erroneous property insurance charges RE : Loan # XXX To Whom It May Concern : 1. XXXX XXXX serviced a loan on my property at XXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX as successor servicer to CitiMortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

2. I am calling into account mismanagement of my account by CITI, which engaged in multiple bookkeeping irregularities, withheld funds inappropriately, failed to notice me properly of actions it took with respect to my account, and conveyed to XXXX XXXX erroneous information about my account including characterizing it as delinquent when in fact CITI had drawn down via automatic payment monthly payments from my checking account for every month that XXXX XXXX serviced the loan as CITIs successor. 

3. Many of the monthly payments CITI conveyed to XXXX XXXX. Many it did not. 

4. CITI apparently failed to communicate to XXXX XXXX that my property was continuously insured by my own insurance agency, without interruption, for the entire time that CITI serviced the loan AND for the entire time that CITI co-serviced the loan with XXXX XXXX. 

5. I have discussed these issues at length with XXXX XXXX service representatives, who have characterized CITIs mismanagement of my loan ( including during the interval that XXXX XXXX was the nominal successor servicer of the loan, but during which time CITI continued to accept my monthly automatic payments and convey them in whole, or in part, to XXXX XXXX ) as nothing short of bizarre, unprecedented, and inexplicable. 

6. XXXX XXXX service representatives have kindly supplied me with transaction logs covering money in and money out of my account while XXXX XXXX acted as successor servicer to CITI.

7. In reviewing the logs ( q.v. ), I was shocked to see that two ( 2 ) separate HAZARD SFR disbursements were made ( one on XXXX, and one on XXXX ) totaling {$4900.00}. 

8. I respectfully request prompt refund to me of this entire amount, inasmuch as : A. I have carried comprehensive property insurance for the entire interval I have owned this property, including the entire time XXXX XXXX serviced the loan. 
B. Any lack of information to this effect would be the fault of CITI, which misrepresented the status of my loan to XXXX XXXX.",Mortgage sold/ customer service,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",MA,1452,Older American,Consent provided,Web,4/23/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3219489

2 ) In late XXXX there were about 4 payments left to pay it in full. In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, CitiMortgage informed me that we were very near payoff, with 4 or fewer payments remaining. 
3 ) In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, CitiBank informed me that, effective XX/XX/XXXX, servicing of my CitiMortgage account # XXXX had been purchased by CitiMortgage, with the exact same address as when it was initiated by CitiMortgage in XXXX, a very confusing letter to say the least. 
4 ) In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, CitiMortgage informed me that servicing of CitiMortgage account # XXXX was to be done by XXXX, effective XX/XX/XXXX, under the new account # XXXX, inviting me to the web site to enroll my new XXXX account for on-line access and payments. Another very confusing letter. 
5 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried repeatedly to call CitiMortgage and XXXX to better understand all the changes as my CitiMortgage account # XXXX was very close to being paid in full. After numerous attempts and long waits on the phone, I was unable to get through to either organization, receiving recorded messages that they were extremely busy with long hold times. 
6 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I accessed CitiMortgage account # XXXX on-line, accessing and reviewing the Account History provided by CitiMortgage for account # XXXX, which noted that the account was paid in full with a "" {$0.00} '' balance, the last payment of {$1600.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX to cover a principal balance of {$1400.00}. 
7 ) As noted in the Account History provided by CitiMortage, the {$1600.00} payment made on XX/XX/XXXX was for an amount greater than the Principal Balance of {$1400.00}. 
8 ) Though the {$1600.00} payment made on XX/XX/XXXX was for {$160.00} more than the Principal Balance, that over-payment was not reflected in the Account History provided by CitiMortgage. 
9 ) One can not help but wonder what happened to that over-payment as noted in item # 8 above?? 
10 ) After numerous attempts on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to reach a representative from XXXX and CitiMortgage : 10-A ) XXXX, with XXXX ( emp ID # XXXX ), was unable to see anything on my new XXXX account # XXXX, suggesting that I call back on Monday, or he would research the situation and get back to me.

25,4/9/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I am including a letter detailing the problem : XX/XX/2019 Citibank Attn. XXXX XXXX, Branch Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX RE : Account No. XXXX XXXX This is a request for reimbursement of two mortgage payments withdrawn in error by Citibank after already being aware that the mortgage was transferred to XXXX and XXXX has their own system for making payments who were receiving payments already on a different date which required a date early in the month. 
We did a careful review of all the XXXX statements, a history of XXXX account detail showing three payments applied over the three-month period and my Citibank statements showing six mortgage payments made in three months with one XXXX payment refunded. Citibank records show the numerous phone calls I made to resolve the situation and correct the duplicate mortgage payments and be refunded for Citibanks error being duplicated each month. Two payments that still need to be refunded were withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively. I was instructed by XXXX to request refund from Citibank on two occasions as it was explained that my request for resolution of the payment mishap was denied by XXXX and the error was completely with Citibank. I received this information initially from XXXX only several days after my initial request for a resolution when the mix-up first occurred. In XXXX when duplicate mortgage payments were about to happen, I notified XXXX prior to the XXXX payment cleared my account. This payment was refunded to me by XXXX via Citibank customer service assistance. 
This problem began three months ago when XXXX took over the mortgage from Citibank. A mortgage form was required by me to set up payments and the new amount was {$1000.00} set for the XXXX of each month. I noticed the first month of the new mortgage was preceded by a Citibank transfer to XXXX on or about the XXXX of each month in the amount of {$760.00}. When duplicate mortgage payments were made at this time, I immediately notified Citibank by phone and in person and phoned XXXX. XXXX assured me that they were taking care of everything and concluded by reassuring me that the error would never happen again. XXXX explained to me that they required a different payment date near the beginning of the month and set the payments for the XXXX of the month. 
The second month of the new mortgage was identical to the first with duplicate payments again. On the day I was to have the problem solved by Citibank Customer Service I brought the problem to the attention XXXX XXXX at Citibank in XXXX, CA. The problem was understood and verified that the duplication had occurred. On XX/XX/XXXX we had a three-way phone call with XXXX and I asked if my money would be refunded and was assured it would be. I asked for a payoff of the loan. It took three days to get the payoff document from XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX I sent a wire to XXXX to payoff the loan in full. 
I found that the month of XXXX is requiring yet another payment by Citibank to XXXX on a loan I paid off XX/XX/2019. After phoning Citibank to resolve the problem, finally it was necessary that the checking account was closed on the XXXX  to protect my account from yet another reversal to my request to delete the scheduled payment. I saw no end in sight to stop the nightmare of erroneous extra payments being scheduled and then occurring no matter and now recovery of my finances is still a real struggle as all money has not been recovered. When the initial duplication of mortgage payments occurred, I used the Citibank online system and deleted the withdrawal scheduled for the old mortgage. Two more months of problems I had the assistance of the mortgage teller to delete the scheduled withdrawal with no success and the next time had XXXX XXXX deleted the scheduled withdrawal without any permanent result. 
I am requesting a reimbursement for two additional errors made by Citibank in the amount of {$1500.00} to be paid to me and sent to my address at XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX.

4,10/27/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Summary : Chase Bank misappropriated our escrow funds to pay property taxes on a property that my husband and I do not own. Chase refuses to reimburse our escrow account until the tax assessor refunds the misappropriated funds to Chase. In the meantime, due to Chase 's negligence, our escrow account reflects a {$11000.00} deficit and our mortgage payments have risen substantially. Prior to Chase 's misappropriation of our escrow funds, in XX/XX/XXXX, our mortgage was {$2600.00}. Using erroneous information, Chase increased our mortgage to {$4300.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and will raise it to {$3500.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. We alerted Chase to its mistakes by telephone and in writing, but Chase refuses to correct the error until the tax assessor returns the funds that Chase misappropriated, a process that Chase admits may take 60 days or more. Below is a detailed accounting of our interactions with Chase followed by a timeline of events. 


Details : In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Chase Bank notified us that, on the same day, it paid {$11000.00} in overdue XXXX real estate property taxes and {$5200.00} in penalty and interest fees to the XXXX XXXX, Texas tax assessor on our behalf for parcel number XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase 's customer service line and a Chase representative confirmed Chase 's payment and our liability for it. After reviewing our closing documents and XXXX XXXX tax records, however, I discovered that Chase 's payment was a mistake. XXXX XXXX, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Texas, is a property owned by the trust of XXXX and XXXX XXXX. To contrast, my husband and I live at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, which is parcel number XXXX. I notified Chase of its wrongful payment in an XX/XX/XXXX phone call to Chase, in an XX/XX/XXXX message from my online Chase account, and in an XX/XX/XXXX letter to Chase. In the XX/XX/XXXX letter, I also requested a new escrow analysis based on XXXX XXXX tax assessor 's updated property tax liability analysis for our property. On XX/XX/XXXX, Chase stated in a letter that there was an overpayment of {$11000.00} on our account for parcel XXXX. The letter said that when the overpayment was returned to Chase, Chase would credit the funds to our escrow balance. To date, Chase has not reimbursed the funds to our escrow account. Additionally, Chase continues to overcharge us based on their accounting errors. According to our amortization schedule, our mortgage, including escrow, should be {$2600.00}. Chase, however, charged us a {$4300.00} mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX and threatens to charge us {$3500.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. 


Additionally, in its XX/XX/XXXX letter to us, Chase intentionally misstated the facts about our escrow account and Chase 's culpability regarding its misappropriation of our escrow account funds. In the letter, Chase states "" there was an overpayment on your account, '' using passive voice to hide the fact that Chase made the overpayment. Additionally, while Chase made the overpayment using our escrow funds, the overpayment was not made for the benefit of our account, as the letter indicates. In fact, Chase used our escrow funds to pay the taxes on a property we do not own. As of the writing of this complaint, Chase has not reimbursed our escrow funds nor paid our property taxes. Instead, Chase has raised our mortgage payments by thousands of dollars. 


Timeline ( all events occurred in XXXX ) : XX/XX/XXXX : Letter from Chase to XXXX notifying that it paid {$11000.00} in overdue XXXX real estate property taxes and {$5200.00} in penalty and interest fees to XXXX XXXX on the XXXX ' behalf for parcel number XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX call to Chase for follow up. Chase representative confirmed the information in the XX/XX/XXXX letter. Neither Chase nor the XXXX realized that the tax payment was a mistake. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Follow-up call from XXXX XXXX XXXX Chase. She spoke with Chase tax department representative XXXX XXXX. XXXX verbally alerted Chase that it used the XXXX ' escrow funds to pay the taxes for the wrong property. XXXX followed up the phone call with a message to Chase via her online account messaging system. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Response message to XXXX XXXX ' online account from Chase agreeing to defer mortgage payment increases for XXXX months. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Letter from XXXX XXXX to Chase alerting Chase to the escrow payment mistake in writing and requesting reimbursement within five business days along with a new escrow analysis based on updated tax information. Attached documents to the letter proved the mistake and included property tax and ownership information for parcels XXXX and XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Chase letter to XXXX stating their escrow payment will be refunded when XXXX XXXX refunds the erroneous tax payment to Chase. 
XX/XX/XXXX : Chase conducted new escrow analysis for XXXX ' mortgage. Chase lowered the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage amount to {$3500.00} due a reduction in taxes, but it did not account for escrow reimbursement. 
XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX XXXX call with Chase representative XXXX XXXX. XXXX confirmed that the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX mortgage bill was {$4300.00} and their XXXX mortgage bill would be {$3500.00}. While on the phone with XXXX, XXXX made a {$2600.00} mortgage payment and {$340.00} principal payment. XXXX made a request for Chase to accept the short mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX ( request case number : XXXX ).

5,10/21/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I am writing to complain about Chase Bank 's unfair insurance claim check funds distribution process. 
In XXXX of 2022 our home was damaged in a hail storm. 
We received funds from our insurance company to replace our roof and repaint the house. 
The check from the insurance company was written out to both myself and my wife, along with Chase Bank as they are the mortgage holder. 
We had to go into the bank and get them to endorse the check. Since the value of the funds received from insurance exceeded $ XXXX, Chase said they had to deposit the funds into an interest bearing account and we then needed to login to a website called XXXX to setup and account and manage the process. 

We were horrified to find this out as we deposited the check on Friday XX/XX/XXXX and the roofing contractor arrived on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to begin work and they told us the roof replacement would only take XXXX days. We immediately went onto the website to request an inspection ( required by Chase ). It took one week ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for an inspector to show up and verify the roof was replaced. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX the contractor showed up to be paid and we could not pay him in full due to Chase holding the funds. Contractor was extremely upset with us reminding us we had a written contract and he was due payment. Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called chase and argued with them and reminded them how urgently we needed the money to be released as we had an extremely upset contract who was due payment. The agreed to disburse 50 % of funds with held. Shockingly, even though the local Chase branch took our check and deposited it in their bank Chase said the only way to receive funds was to have the check mailed to us and there was not an option to go back into the branch and receive a check. 
It wasn't until the following Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX that the check arrived in the mail. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX the painters showed up to paint the house. I am again in the same situation where they have completed their work and Chase is still with holding the funds and we are unable to pay the contractor.

Timeline of events is as follows : Friday XX/XX/XXXX Chase takes the funds. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX we setup the required account with XXXX. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX roofers show up to begin work. 
Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX we request an inspection. XXXX says it will take 2-4 business days for someone to contact us. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX the roofing contractor finishes his work and asks for payment. We can not pay in full since Chase is holding funds. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXX I call Chase XXXX to complain/ argue they are inappropriately withholding money due the contractor. They say it takes time for the process to work through but agree to release 50 % of the funds. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX painters show up to paint the house. 
Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX the inspector finally shows up and does the inspection. 
Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX the check shows up so we can pay the roofers. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I call Chase XXXX to complain that the inspection still does not show complete even though the people were there two days previous. I can not schedule the final inspection until the first inspection shows complete. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXX I call Chase XXXX to complain again that the first inspection still does not show complete and I can't schedule the final inspection ( which will take an additional week to get on the books for someone to come out ). Contractor again is extremely upset they are not getting paid as agreed to in the contract. 

Shame on you Chase for instituting such a cumbersome non-responsive process for customers to receive the funds they are due and owed.

6,10/21/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Chase Bank has wrongfully forced my mortgage into escrow and failed to refund the {$1100.00} it took from my account. Chase has withdrawn, or plans to withdraw, 60 % to 300 % increases to my mortgage payment. 
I demand that the bank return the money owed to me from the wrongfully forced escrow and stop charging me for money that I do not owe under this mortgage. 

BACKGROUND On or about XX/XX/2021, I executed a fixed-rate loan for {$1100.00} monthly. Exhibit A. No escrow was authorized. Exhibit A. The closing disclosure states that the amount can not increase after closing. My loan was subsequently sold to Chase. I enrolled in autopay for the mortgage so that the {$1100.00} payment would be automatically drafted from my account. 

WRONGFULLY FORCED ESCROW Chase withdrew {$1700.00} from my account on XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 66 % increase in my monthly payment. When I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, an agent claimed the increase was due to a forced escrow. Chase had apparently not received updated homeowners insurance. But the bank also failed to request updated insurance information from me after the loan was sold to them. 

INSURANCE ACCEPTED WITHOUT LAPSE IN COVERAGE On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent in proof of insurance to Chase. Exhibit B. Chase accepted it during a phone call. Exhibit C. The home had no lapse in coverage. During that phone call, Chase said that it would refund the money that was automatically taken from my account. The agent claimed it would take about a week. I asked whether the notice that I received on XX/XX/XXXX stating that Chase would withdraw {$1700.00} was accurate. They said no, they would not draft that amount, instead, it would be the {$1100.00} amount that did not include the forced escrow. 

WITHDRAWALS FOR ESCROW CONTINUE On XX/XX/XXXX, {$1700.00} was wrongfully taken from my account. The amount included the {$590.00} in extra payments that Chase knew it wasnt entitled to. 
I called again. Chases agent again represented that Chase would refund the now {$1100.00} wrongfully removed from my account. But they also said that during the original phone call in XXXX, someone at Chase had dated the close of the escrow as XX/XX/XXXX. 
The agent did not understand the reason for the delay. But they claimed their hands were tied. They would continue to draft that {$1700.00} from my account in XXXX. They were not authorized to stop the draft for that amount, but a supervisor may have that authority. 

AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS CANCELLED DUE TO CONTINUED DRAFTS FOR UNAUTHORIZED ESCROW A supervisor, XXXX, said that she would cancel my automatic payments with Chase so that the XXXX escrow would not be drafted from my account. Instead, she suggested that I authorize payment of the {$1100.00} over the phone so that the mortgage would remain current. She later called requesting to close the complaint since it would be over by XX/XX/XXXX. I told her no, not until the money is refunded and the payments are for the agreed-to {$1100.00} monthly. 

CHASES XXXX MONTHLY STATEMENT IS XXXX TIMES THE AUTHORIZED AMOUNT On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice from Chase that I must pay {$3500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for my monthly mortgage payment. Exhibit D. My mortgage is supposed to be only {$1100.00} per month. This is more than a 300 % increase in the amount of the payment for my home. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase. A representative from Chase said that they realize I do not owe {$3500.00} for a monthly payment, but that its system sometimes makes strange invoices in situations like these. They assured me that I did not owe that money. But that was the same assurance made before when they drafted more than agreed to. 

REFUND NOT ISSUED MORE THAN 60 DAYS LATER I have not received a refund of the {$1100.00} taken from my account for this improperly forced escrow. These withdrawals started on XX/XX/XXXX, which is 64 days ago. 
On the phone, Chase agents concede that its actions were wrong and harmful. But Chases written notices are inconsistent with the phone calls. The notice that I owe more than XXXX times my monthly payment is a knowingly false misrepresentation.",Mortgage/ Loan purchased,NA,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,76712,NA,Consent provided,Web,10/21/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6114970
7,10/13/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"After XXXX XXXX in XXXX, the insurance rates in Louisiana were affected. In my case, my insurance provider left the local market and forced us into "" an insurer of last resort. '' This raised the rates that would be withdrawn from my escrow account. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from my lender, Chase, that informed me of three payment options as a result of the escrow shortage. The letter was vaguely written. Was the payment a pure escrow payment or did it include the monthly mortgage payment as well? Since it presented three options, which included just making the regular monthly payment, I interpreted the letter to include both the monthly payment plus escrow. However, not wanting to be late or incorrect, I went to a local Chase branch for consultation. The banker advised me that the payment was for both the monthly payment and escrow shortage. I paid the advised amount. 


The following month, in XXXX, I made my payment the normal way I do, which is through my XXXX XXXX  Bill Pay service. A few days later, I received a letter from Chase notifying me that they did not receive my XXXX payment. I called Chase to confirm the validity of this letter and to inquire about the XXXX payment. They notified me that the payment was received at the bank, but that the bank applied the whole amount strictly to escrow. I explained to them that I met with their bank representatives and confirmed the process and payment amount and that I paid as instructed by both the letter and the representative. They insisted that it was still my fault. 

I asked how do we resolve this, because I have proof that I paid it ( cancelled check from the bank ) and they admitted they can see the payment. They insisted that the account was "" locked '' or "" red '' and that no corrections could be made until the account "" showed green. '' How I asked? They said I had to provide an immediate payment via their "" check by phone. '' I complied. 


After sending the check, I immediately checked my credit report. Chase, in less than a 30 day window, reported my payment late to the credit bureaus. My credit score dropped from an XXXX to XXXX over this single and only negative comment that isn't even my fault. I made the payment as instructed at their branch. I wanted this corrected. 


I have spoken to Chase representatives to get this corrected. They have taken my complaint, can see the payment in question, have corrected the misapplication, waived the late fee and admitted their error. A work order was created to correct the credit report. After three weeks of waiting for a copy of this correction in the mail I did not receive it. Neither have the credit bureaus. 


I have contacted Chase again and I have now been informed that they have decided to not issue the credit report amendment as indicated in previous calls. They are now telling me that I have not provided them with enough proof that I made the payment. They have stated that they will contact the local bank to see if they can confirm my version of events. My credit history now hangs in the balance of the memory of a bank employee who already mistakenly applied the funds entirely to escrow. How is this right? How is this not fraud? 


This is not the first time I have had issues with Chase as it relates to this same mortgage account. A few years ago, Chase, without warning, sent me a FedEx envelope with a {$1500.00} refund check and a mortgage rate adjustment. The included letter stated that this was because of my XXXX XXXX military service. The problem is I am not XXXX XXXX military. I called them to explain this to them and they insisted I was wrong. I demanded that they cancel the check, return the allocated funds to the correct account, and return my interest rate to the correct amount.

Then two weeks later I received a letter saying that I was being turned over to collections for not paying my mortgage for three months. Chase cashed all of those checks but said I didn't pay. I had to get copies of those three checks sent from my bank to Chase to prove it was paid. Chase put those funds in a phantom account linked to my mortgage but didn't apply them resulting in an erroneous delinquency.

After the first year, Chase Bank bought out my Loan. Once they bought it out, the loan amount suddenly jumped up to {$2900.00} compared to the {$2700.00} it was with XXXX XXXX. I called and emailed them to find out why it was so much more and all I received was This is what we calculated. I told them that my taxes, and insurance did not go up that much. My taxes went from {$4400.00} to {$5000.00}, which is a difference of {$630.00}. My insurance went from {$2300.00} to {$2500.00}, which is a difference of {$230.00}. That is a total difference of only {$860.00}, which is only an extra {$72.00} per month, on average.

I kept paying my original payment until I could actually get any answers. Throughout the year, the numbers on my online statement kept changing drastically. One time they said I owe {$12000.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX I tried to pay online but their website would only allow me to enter my {$2700.00}. During XXXX I had XXXX XXXX and was not able to go into the bank to make a payment. 

In XXXX, I went into Chase Bank in XXXX, MN. I was able to get help from XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX. She agreed that my account did not look correct, and we could not understand why my payment went up so much. While on the phone with a Mortgage Specialist from Chase Bank, I asked to have the escrow removed and clarified that I will pay my taxes and insurance moving forward. I also stated that I expect an updated balance reflecting this change and requested that they remove the late payments they added during this period. The employee said that they will remove the escrow and the paperwork will be sent to my home in 10 business days. After the call with the Chase Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX and I both agreed that moving forward I would only be paying the principle of {$2100.00} to Chase and that I would be responsible for the escrow. 

A couple of weeks went by and I still had not received any information. With that, once again I went into their location to talk with XXXX XXXX. We called their Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX, as she was the one that submitted the request to remove the escrow and then also stated a written-up letter would be needed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent the letter to XXXX XXXX, informing Chase that I will be taking care of the insurance and taxes moving forward. 

Another couple of weeks later, they sent me a letter stating that they can not remove the escrow because of the late payments, which I fully disagreed on how they charged my accounts. I then reached out to my insurance agent and asked them to remove Chase Mortgage from their billing and send it straight to myself. Once my insurance company sent me the bill, I paid it in full on XXXX ( {$2500.00} ). The next day I went to XXXX XXXX to pay for the XXXX taxes. On XXXX I paid {$2500.00} and received a paid in full receipt from XXXX XXXX. On XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX showing pictures of the receipts stating my taxes and insurance were both paid in full and requested her to update my account. 

A couple weeks ago, I received a check from my insurance company for {$2500.00} for an extra payment on the account. I reached out to my agent and asked why they sent me that amount back. My agent looked into the payment details and saw that Chase Bank had sent in the payment. My agent stated that they never sent them a bill but in fact sent them a letter stating that the bill was paid in full. 

As of today, Chase is now stating my mortgage should be {$3100.00}, which would entail {$970.00} in escrow payments each month, for an annual total of {$11000.00}. What?? When the 2022 year began, my escrow added up to a total of {$7600.00}. Where is the extra {$4000.00} now coming from? 

This has been months and months of ongoing headaches and extra work to essentially get nowhere and no answers. I would never do business with Chase Bank again and would request to transfer my mortgage to another company, if possible. I feel I have been lied to and fraud has occurred with the extra fees and incorrect amounts credited to my mortgage when Chase took over my account. XXXX XXXX has also not been easy to work with. I feel she has had fraud applied to my account as well with the extra payment they made to my insurance company and placing late fees. In speaking with my attorney, he suggested filing this claim first before moving forward with other actions. I have not missed a mortgage payment or had this much trouble with a mortgage company since I have owned a house. Even on my credit report I have XXXX late payments.

16,8/23/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I was under Covid protection/mortgage forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. I was told, under this, repeatedly, any missed payments were deferred and would be due as a balloon payment at the end of my loan term. When I expressed concern about my ability to make a balloon payment in such a short space of time, I was advised the loan would be converted to a 30 year/not to worry/cross that bridge, etc. 

In early XXXX, I reached out and was initially offered a deferment, although, at that point, my loan was current. I don't recall the name, but I did receive a call/had conversations on XX/XX/XXXX with a gentleman who identified himself as my personal "" account specialist ''. The conversation we had was very difficult to understand ( he sounded like he was underwater ) and I never heard from him again. He told me I was no longer eligible for forbearance and something of something that "" my situation had changed ''. I received no further communications of any sort about this. 

In XXXX I contacted Chase ( I believe mortgage forbearance, again ) and was cheerfully informed to not worry, I was eligible for a deferment and would I like to accept it? I agreed, it was a two month deferment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( I know because I had a handyman over, have pictures of the new door uploaded on my phone ), I received a notice my account was now 5 months past due, I must pay the entire past due amount immediately or I would be foreclosed on. I called the number on the notice. The very nice and helpful lady who answered immediately told me I was "" eligible for a deferment and that would bring my account current, would I like to take that? "". I did, but I again made a point of discussing that my account should not BE approaching foreclosure, because it was, at most 60 days past due. 

I believe this was essentially ignored/brushed aside and I was told to not concern myself about this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( I'm basing this on my payday -- -so I attempted to make a payment when my mortgage was either 60 days late, not the 150 days you continued to claim ), I submitted an online payment for half my mortgage payment. It was rejected. I inquired as to why and a copy of your "" good-bye letter '' was sent to me electronically. IT specifically states "" nothing will change about my account except for who I remit my payments to ''. I also called customer service about it, multiple times and was assured there would be a 60 day freeze of any negative activity and, since I was ( once again ) eligible for a deferment, that would be honored. 

I immediately began seeking to communicate with XXXX and was in later Approved for a trial payment plan/loan modification, even though the account would have been still frozen. I made my first trial payment to XXXX on or before XX/XX/XXXX, because it posted on that date. I would later be informed it "" doesn't count '' because it was made before the 60 day freeze was over ( or some such ). 

I decided during this time frame, while I had been treated unfairly, I would move forward because the modification would allow me to resume payments and pay off my loan, the only thing I had ever wanted to do. 

In a conversation with my Single Point of Contact/Loss Mitigation XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX also included, so she and Shellpoint XXXX XXXX made aware of this, as I have requested, I was informed a Quit Claim Deed would be needed to proceed with the loan modification, once my trial payments were concluded successfully. 

I had not heard of this, was under the impression the property merely awarded to me is sufficient, but this is not the case. I was further informed in multiple, subsequent conversations with other XXXX representatives, XXXX would likely proceed with foreclosure if I did not obtain a Quit Claim Deed, which my ex refuses to sign. 

In one of these conversations ( I had always planned on making much larger payments, anyway, as again, my only wish was to pay off my loan and live in my house ), I inquired about other options. I was informed even if I was deferment eligible, XXXX must have that in writing and they considered that to then be due immediately and upfront. Further more, because the last payment made ( ignoring the unapplied trial payments ) and they also ignored the Covid Mortgage protection, they considered my loan to be a full year past due and I must make 12 payments ( nearly the entire loan, in fact ) upfront. If I wanted to make a "" mere '' 3 upfront payments, I needed to prove, in writing, it was only 90 days past due when it came to them. Honestly, even {$4300.00} would be a struggle for me, but I'd certainly seek to find a way. 

With this information, I reached out to Chase customer service to give me documents that supported my assertions. Each secure message grew progressively rude, dismissive and snotty. And failed to give me the information I had requested. The second such communication was so obnoxious, I realized this action has been illegal, advised I'd be pursuing legal action and submitting regulatory complaints unless I was satisfied. My complaint was escalated to XXXX XXXX ( not sure of the spelling ). I was assured of a reply within in 3 business days. 

I also began some cursory internet research and uncovered a variety of lawsuits and actions against Chase that are remarkably similar to my situation, indicating precedent and an ongoing pattern dating back over a decade. 

I called the line I was given for Mortgage Escalations ( XXXX ) daily : Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, Friday XX/XX/XXXX and Monday XXXX. I was assured "" an email was being sent '' to XXXX about this and he would call me as soon as he "" had completed his investigation ''. When I called Monday, I was first brushed off similarly, then the associate noticed a not had been left, again, brushing and dismissing my concerns. No one bothered to call and inquire as to specifics, nor did anybody seem concerned about my issue or my continued assurances of my intent to pursue legal action. 

I immediately demanded a supervisor and/or the Executive Office . The associate repeatedly tried to talk me out of this insisting, 'this is something we do all the time ''. Yes, I am fully aware you are legally entitled to sell my loan at any time, for any reason or no reason. You are NOT entitled to make verbal contracts with me, breach them and not inform me. You are not entitled to record incorrect information and not correct it or justify it when I've brought it to your attention. 

Ultimately, I sent this summary to my "" executive '' and was told, after an extensive amount of time, that my mortgage "" was ineligible for deferment because the amount was so small ''.

Within a month of closing, my loan was sold to Chase bank. That same month, Chase bank erroneously used the remaining funds in my escrow account to send a duplicate payment to the XXXX of XXXX for XXXX XXXX taxes, causing my escrow acccount to go negative. 

Now Chase has completed an escrow analysis and indicated a shortage, which is largely the result of not carrying over the escrow balance into XXXX as they should have done. Chase has now increased my monthly payment by over $ XXXXmonth to account for the shortage. 

They are claiming that it is my responsibility to request that the XXXX of XXXX refund the double payment to me, which I must then pay to Chase toward the escrow account. As the XXXX of XXXX has already applied this double payment to my XXXX XXXX taxes, this does not seem like a likely scenario. 

Chase made the error, and now I'm supposed to either pay for it or jump through hoops for the slight possibility of getting it corrected. In the meantime, I was warned that if I do not make the payment for XXXX, which I have disputed, I face late fees and negative credit reporting.

If payment is received within 10 days, I will be reinstated ; otherwise, I will have a lapse in coverage. I called Chase the day I received the letter and spoke with a rep in their insurance department. The long and short of it is someone within Chase deemed my house a "" demolished property '' and therefore, they do not collect an insurance premium for a year while the house is supposedly being rebuilt. All I had was roof damage. It was never demolished. Their rep told me he has been a banker with Chase for 11 years and has "" never seen this level of incompetence '' and used the words "" flabbergasted '' and "" egregious error '' repeatedly during our conversation. He also told me that he was escalating my case and a supervisor would contact me w/in 24-48 hours. Of course, no one has.

32,6/23/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I purchased my home/condo in XXXX of XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a delinquent tax payment notice from the XXXX of XXXX. 
I called the Chase Mortgage department and found the most helpful person of all my experiences who actually fixed something for me. After that no one was any help at all. 
XXXX, asked questions and determined that my condo used to be classified as a rental apt before my purchase as a condo. So, the coding for payment changed. 
She contacted the XXXX of XXXX and resolved and paid the tax and also she told me that Chase would of course be responsible for any late charges. She called me on the phone to let me know it was resolved. 
It was the ONLY time that any Chase agent ever followed up with a return call to me. 


In the summer of XXXX I received a check from Chase mortgage that I had extra money in my escrow and was getting a refund check. I received that check in XXXX for {$1300.00}. 
I knew something was wrong. Ive owned another property for over 20 years and knew there was never one that large. 
I also looked at the amount that was for the school tax due in XXXX {$1300.00}. 
Weird coincidence the amount they gave me back was almost exactly what was due in XXXX. 

I started getting notices about the unpaid school tax that was due in XX/XX/XXXX the beginning of XXXX, is my best recollection. It is possible I may have missed one in my documentation earlier. 

I contacted Chase Mortgage on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX ( unknown last name ). 
I told him my school tax was delinquent and I knew what the problem was. He was very disinterested. He did tell me that it got paid but I told him the payment, even though showing in their records did NOT GO THROUGH. I tried to explain to him that I knew what the issue was since it happened earlier this year and XXXX found the cause. The coding changed. I am not even sure that he even wrote that in any notes. I had the answer! 
I was told something about getting back in touch with me in 18 days ( cant remember business or calendar ). 
I told him I was refunded almost the same amount that was due. 

XXXX asked me to upload documents to Chases website related to delinquent taxes. 
Which I did. 

I was worried that Im in trouble for not paying taxes and called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX who gave me a reference number of XXXX. 
Again I tried to explain. 


I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX. Again telling the same story that the tax wasnt paid and that they refunded me a check almost for that amount from my escrow. 
I can not remember if it was XXXX or that I spoke with XXXX again who told me that they did speak with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who said the tax payment made end of XXXX went through. 
That wasnt the issue I said! It was for the XXXX payment. But I only got responses of its all set. 

It wasnt. 
A few times calling I specifically asked a few people, women, so not XXXX or XXXX and said that I had this extra money from that refund. Should I put it back in my escrow so they can get it paid? One told me that I could if I wanted. I was always allowed to put extra money in but another told me to wait until this was settled. Not to do anything yet. 
So I didnt. 

At the end of the year of XXXX I got my tax statement, form 1098. It showed that the yearly taxes paid were only {$3200.00}. I knew they were supposed to be {$4600.00}. Again, this mostly proves that they didnt pay that tax and just sent me a refund check for extra money in my escrow. 

Now, the penalties are wracking up but I knew the issue. No one was listening. 
I felt it was on Chase to pay those penalties, not me. 
Id done everything I could to get this straightened out with mostly no help. 
NO ONE ever called me back each time. 

Somewhere between this time and XXXX I FINALLY received the first response since the School tax issue started. A letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Chase told me that they were going to directly deposit {$200.00} into my escrow since they saw that I had paid that missing tax payment and paid penalties. 

I had not paid it. At some point that must have been the penalty due, which increased after this. 

I monitored my escrow to see if XXXX ever reimbursed me that amount. 
I never saw a thing. 

I called and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I told her this wasnt settled! Should I just pay it now and let Chase figure out the penalty? No, just wait. She reopened the case on and gave me reference number XXXX. She said someone would respond to me in XXXX days again. 

I corresponded multiple times around then with XXXX and XXXX from the XXXX of XXXX for late payments. They said theyd had no contact from Chase and the amount was still delinquent with further penalties. 

I spoke with XXXX and told them I was sending in the {$1300.00} and could I please have a payment plan ( they had offered XXXX ) to pay the penalty? 
XXXX told me to go ahead and mail in the {$1300.00}. That was paid XX/XX/XXXX. 



On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase Mortgage and spoke with XXXX. She was the XXXX person who actually looked at everything and saw that a payment had gotten missed. XXXX guessing paid but rejected due to the new coding. But I was so relieved and told her that maybe XXXX just pay the {$1300.00} Chase refunded me and could she request that Chase pay the penalties. Which changed multiple times but at this point I think was {$380.00}. 
She told me she would put in a request for a reimbursement be paid to me. 

No word again. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX taxes writes me and says that if I dont pay the delinquent charges that I will not get my STAR rebate. 
I though the tax department was going to do a payment plan but they wanted it all right away if I wanted my rebate. 
So now XXXX told me the grand total for delinquent charges was {$390.00}. 
I just paid the whole amount on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I called Chase again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX or XXXX ( again I never was told a last name ). 
She looked at my records and told me that my request was denied since the coding on the payment changed and it was not their fault. 

XXXX horrified as I TOLD THEM MULITIPLE TIMES WHAT THE ISSUE WAS! If they didnt keep putting me off I would have just paid it long ago and never been hit with penalties. 
They just kept making me think they were going to take care of things. 
XXXX insulted that no one listened. That this should have been cleared up long ago. 
That the penalty I paid of {$390.00} should very well be paid by Chase. Their excuse/reason is WRONG as I told them over and over. 

Ive gone through much anger and sleepless nights over this while I mostly fell on deaf ears. 
Way back in early XXXX when XXXX figured it out, she assured me that Chase would pay any penalty. Now XXXX told that its not their fault? Their fault for not listening to customers telling them whats wrong.

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife attempted to make a payment using the online portal, at which time the system instructed her to accept the Transfer Service Agreement.

She made several attempts to accept the agreement and make a payment, each time with identical results to the first attempt. 

At that point, and on the same day, she called Chase and was transferred a few times before speaking with a technical specialist. This individual had her attempt multiple unusual fixes, such as adding a fake payment account to the system. We ended that call as nothing was being accomplished.

When I spoke with the customer-service representative for Chase as I made this payment, she indicated that I would be contacted within approximately two weeks in order to schedule a broker-price opinion ( "" BPO '' ) so that Chase could confirm the value of the house and the presence of the new solar panels, which were contracted in XX/XX/XXXX and completed installation in XX/XX/XXXX. I did not record my phone call from XX/XX/XXXX with Chase, but the CSR made it sound as if this next step would occur without me having to do anything - I might receive something in the mail but I would not have to watch closely or worry about anything.

After Chase agreed to accept this proof of purchase, they then said that they could not proceed because they had already refunded my initial payment of {$150.00} for the BPO in late XX/XX/XXXX. I asked which account they had refunded it to, and Chase replied that they had sent a check to my home address. I advised Chase that I had not received a check, and they agreed that whatever they might had sent had not been cashed or deposited. I told Chase that I had cleaned house and opened all my old paper mail in late XXXX, so I was pretty sure that I was not in possession of the check, but that if I did find the check I would either destroy it or mail it back - whatever they preferred. 

At this point, I feel like I'm being given the runaround, and that Chase does not want to fulfill its side in evaluating my primary residence for removal of PMI. I understand that mortgages can be complicated and that there are some fraud-committing "" bad actors '' out there. I feel like my actions have been aboveboard, and that Chase is trying to avoid losing a revenue stream. I am deeply frustrated, because ( 1 ) I feel that I am being treated poorly ; ( 2 ) I doubt that there's any way to recoup the PMI payments for the months that Chase has been giving me the runaround ; ( 3 ) I suspect that there are a not-insubstantial number of people out there who will be treated similarly by Chase and who will give up or be unable to find recourse. 

The only good things that I have to say about Chase during this saga is that their online correspondence has been polite and they haven't tried to edit or delete any of the messages in the online portal ( so they haven't tampered with the evidence/history regarding my issue ).",PMI,NA,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,CO,80010,NA,Consent provided,Web,5/14/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,5561212

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- I Called Chase. After about 30 minutes on the phone I am told it is against Chase policy to accept payments from savings accounts at another bank. I ask to have the issue escalated to supervisor. Supervisor states Chase policy is not to accept ANY payments from other banks except those that are checking accounts.

I paid it, believing it to be some sort of one-off adjustment to my escrow account, but then it happened again. I called the bank and they told me that FEMA had changed its maps and I was now in a flood zone. They also told me they had sent me notices by snail mail while I was out of the country, despite the fact that I opted for paperless banking years ago. 

The sent me, via e-mail, the notices from last year. The notices tell me to request a Letter of Map Amendment ( LOMA ) or Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill ( LOMR-F ) from FEMA if I think FEMA made a mistake, but I checked the map, and FEMA did not make a mistake. The bank did. In fact, they made three large mistakes, possibly with multiple errors within them. First, they failed to read the maps correctly. Second, they failed to contact me electronically, even though I had opted for paperless banking years ago. Third, even if they had contacted me electronically, as they are supposed to, the time it takes to get a LOMA would have left me in the same predicament. 

I spoke to FEMA, and they agreed I am not in a flood zone. They were able to walk through the map with me, and they told me I can still request a LOMA to be safe, but it would take six weeks to get. 

This may have begun as an honest mistake, but the mistake is not mine. Our house is one of six structurally distinct townhouses aligned along one street address but each with its own city address ( designated by numbers followed by letters ), as well as city services, deeds, homeowners insurance, utilities, plumbing, etc. Our house is far from the lake, and our elevation above the lake is substantial. We have no flood risk and are outside both the FEMA flood zone and all designated flood zones in other risk maps. 

Chase 's flood control team is hermetically sealed in a bunker in Ohio and can only be reached via fax. Even the Chase mortgage and insurance teams can't reach them any other way. 

The Chase mortgage team transferred me to the insurance team, which told me I still need to get a form from FEMA, which will take six weeks, and I have to either get cheaper insurance in the interim or trust them to refund my money when they see they are wrong.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back and was told that, due to the high amount, it was being checked again and it would be a couple more days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and was told the amount had changed due to a change in my property taxes. The amount they quoted me was incorrect. I gave them the correct amount on that same call. I was told that in a few days I would have the money. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again having still received no money nor communication. I was told that I should have received the money and they were sorry, but due to their error with the property taxes, they were doing more analysis and would do an electronic funds transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and they had no explanation for the delay. I was placed on hold for twenty minutes with my operator as she waited with me to try and reach someone in the company to help.

I informed her that, according to the CFPB and CFR 1024.17 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act they had 30 calendar days from the analysis to give me any surplus over {$50.00} and if I didnt receive the money that day they would be in violation of federal law and I would file a complaint with the CFPB. As of the close of business, I have not received any money or subsequent communication from the company. As it has been 30 days they have violated these rules as I understand them. Furthermore, the size of the surplus is especially troubling given that the mortgage is 8 months old and it was a refinance of my prior loan for which I provided all necessary documentation of property taxes and home owners insurance. The surplus represents more than 50 % of my annual property taxes in total.

The pool building process took one year from contract and it was literally not possible to have water in the pool due to ongoing COVID related delays in materials, manpower, sub contractors, etc. Without a proper electrical hookup, they could not complete the job in a more timely manner. The mortgage company Chase sent me a letter advising that insurance was required or else they would buy it for me. I called them immediately upon receiving this letter, telling them about the predicament, and asking how long I had before they purchased a policy for me. I was told eight weeks. Six weeks later, the pool company completed their job, water was in the pool, and I was covered once again by XXXX with the same prior policy details. 

In mid-XXXX, I received another letter from Chase advising that I need to provide proof of coverage for the six week period I was without or else they would buy a policy for me in the exorbitant amount of {$1100.00}. As providing such a proof of coverage is impossible, I called Chase on three separate occasions asking what could be done. If nothing could be done from a relationship perspective, then the policy is what it is and I am left with no recourse. However, all letters received indicate that insurance MAY be purchased for me, at no point does it ever indicate that insurance WAS purchased. Despite this, apparently such coverage was purchased on my behalf and this {$1100.00} ( for SIX weeks ) will be taken from my escrow account over time.

At no point did Chase ever 1 ) Tell me that insurance was actually purchased 2 ) Who the insurance was with 3 ) What was actually going to be covered by this completely retroactive policy. The fact that a lender is able to use my money months later to purchase a policy and provide absolutely zero insight into the details of this policy or at least even be able to clearly confirm that such a policy was even purchased is appalling since their last letter continues to indicate that I may be charged. Without being provided such details in a more timely manner, it becomes more unlikely and less plausible that I would even be able to utilize this policy to file a retroactive claim against, thus making this practice seem unfair to the consumer. Again, my lack of coverage for this period of time was completely involuntary and since the insurer of last resort for the state of Florida dropped me explicitly due to the lack of water being in a pool, it does not seem likely that another provider would overlook this, thus another reason why obtaining insight into these phantom policy details would be of interest.",Escrow issues,NA,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,FL,34698,NA,Consent provided,Web,4/14/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,5447402

Now they are trying to lift the stay. We found out new information on the loan. They have tried to foreclose 5 times. 2 of the times they filed unauthorized assignments so they could proceed to foreclosure, They do not have any proper assignments. The service does not have the servicing rights, they did at one time but they were replaced. There are other issues but they are foreclosing based on the 2 assignments. I will attach them. Our house is paid for, and XXXX and XXXX are trying to foreclose. They ignore all the laws that are in place to protect Homeowners property rights. XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the servicer ) cant even produce a signed note. I know for a fact, and I can prove that they lack standing. But I keep getting told that Judges don't want to hear about lack of standing. My main argument is still we paid for the house. Attached is a Loan Summary that will give a quick background. I think it will give you a good idea as to what is going on and if you think you can help us. I know we're just one family, but I think they are doing it to other families, and it is unfair, they bully and intimidate, and they have falsified documents to cover their deficiencies on the chain of title, payment histories, etc. One of their biggest arguments is that we signed, under duress mind you and with false information, modification agreements so it does not matter what we paid, and they do not have to give us a payment history back to the beginning of the loan. The loan was closed in XXXX and they only have a payment history back to XXXX. We have disputed the balance for years. The first Servicer did not give us credit for about {$52000.00} in payments. I have several pages of documents that I can provide but I thought I would give you an overview again to see if this is something you can help us with. XXXX has recorded assignments with the county using one of their Attorneys who claimed to be a certifying officer assigning the loan from one entity to another. He was not a Certifying Officer I can prove it. He did this so they could try to foreclose. They have tried to foreclose 5 times forcing us into agreements. Agreements they are now using to say we do not have the right to know the history of our Loan. We have all the payment support, and they ignore it. They have ignored it since XXXX. All we want is credit for all payments we have made. Payments that paid the loan in XXXX. We did not realize that it was paid off until recently, because we could never get a proper accounting of the loan. We spent weeks tracking down all the records for 15 years of transactions. We put it in a spreadsheet and found out it paid off even earlier than we had anticipated. We are tired of all the intimidation and legal twisting of the truth. We need help with the legal predatory behaviors of XXXX and their Client XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have decided to include a timeline of the loan I hope that is not too much for now.

I called on XX/XX/XXXX to injury about how to drop my PMI ( private mortgage insurance ). I was told that I would have to get a broker price opinion ( BPO ).

I did see this fee get charged and placed on my mortgage account. I then waited another 10 business days and called Chase back. I was told that the funds were processed incorrectly and that the {$150.00} went to the principle. I explained that I still had not received a call from a BPO agent and since this had been well over the initial 7 business days this should be expedite. I was placed on the phone with an "" expedited case manager ''. I explain to him that I would like to know what BPO agent was assigned to my account given it had been greater than their policy of 7 business days. The expedited case manager could not help.

58,3/2/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I am filing this complaint against JPMorgan Chase ( Chase ) because, as will be explained in detail below, Chase missed payment on my homeowners insurance premium, resulting in a lapse in insurance coverage between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX; failed to notify me of the lapse in coverage for three months ; and is now attempting to charge me outrageous fees for retroactive insurance coverage. I have spent hours on the telephone with various representatives at Chase attempting to resolve this issue. However, Chase refuses to accept any responsibility for its own errors and omissions, and has instead provided nothing but conflicting and contradictory excuses for this egregious mistake. Ultimately, my home was not insured for three months through no fault of my own, without my knowledge, and without my ability to resolve or mitigate the issue. I respectfully request that the CFPB review these unfair acts and practices committed by Chase, and that CFPB conduct a careful review of Chases internal policies and procedures that, as my experience makes clear, inadequately protect Chases customers. 

* * * I purchased my home in XX/XX/XXXX, obtaining my mortgage through a local mortgage provider. They subsequently sold my mortgage to Chase, which became my servicer effective XX/XX/XXXX. 
//// My home insurance policy came up for renewal on XX/XX/XXXX. Chase failed to pay the premium, resulting in the policys cancellation. Chase made no effort to communicate with me during this period, and I did not realize that I lacked home insurance until XX/XX/XXXX, when Chase sent me a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, informing me that they needed proof of my home insurance. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted my insurance agent and asked her to send Chase the requested documentation. She quickly identified that my insurance had been canceled and immediately took out a new policy for me, effective XX/XX/XXXX. My insurance company charged me a {$50.00} fee to account for the gap in my coverage. 
//// Chase sent me a second letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, informing me that although they now had proof of my current insurance, they still needed proof that I had homeowners insurance during the three-month period between when my first policy was cancelled and when I took out the new policy. In the absence of such evidence, Chase said that they would take out their own policy for the gap period, charging me a premium of {$830.00}, which is approximately twice the premium I pay for my other insurance over a three-month period. This makes little sense. First, a retroactive insurance policy is, by definition, for a period of time that has already passed, and so can never be subject to an insurance claim ; it thus serves no practical purpose, and yet would create a windfall for the insurance company that sold the policy. Second, and most importantly, the gap that Chase wanted to charge me to fill was caused by Chases own failure to pay my premium in XX/XX/XXXX. 
//// I received the XX/XX/XXXX letter on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, and I called Chases customer service line for the first time on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. Chases representatives proceeded to tell me three different, inconsistent stories for why they did not pay my insurance premium, and continued to insist that they would charge me $ 800+ unless I could somehow take out a retroactive insurance policy to cover the gap. 
//// First, Chases Insurance groups representative took the position that Chase had no obligation at all to pay my home insurance premium in XX/XX/XXXX. In her telling, Chase had only acquired my mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX, and was not responsible for paying my premium until Chase had serviced my mortgage for at least a year, sometime after XX/XX/XXXX. By this logic, I was responsible for directly paying my insurance premium until it came due for the third time in XX/XX/XXXX. This, despite the fact that Id been paying insurance premiums into my escrow since XX/XX/XXXX. She seemed to see no difference between Chases obligations if it had originated a mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX, compared to Chases obligations when it acquired a mortgage with a preexisting escrow account. I asked the Chase representative when Chase had ever informed me of my responsibility to pay my second years premium, and she dodged the question. 
//// The representative then connected me to a second representative, from Chases Mortgage group , so that the three of us could better understand what had happened. At that point I was given the second version of why Chase had failed to pay my premiumthat in XX/XX/XXXX Chase had attempted to contact the insurance company to pay my premium, but had difficulty getting the insurance company to call them back. I was told that, in the face of this communication issue, Chase let my coverage lapse ; and it didnt take the most obvious step to mitigate the situationcontact me so I could help them resolve their difficulties and ensure that my home remained insured. 
//// Nevertheless, Chases representatives told me that this was MY fault. They said they suspected that my insurance company was not responsive to them because it did not know that I had a new mortgage servicer, and that I should have contacted my insurance company to tell them to send my XX/XX/XXXX bill to Chase. This position directly contradicted the statements that Chase had made to me in its XX/XX/XXXX welcome letter, informing me that they would begin servicing my mortgage. The letter said, among other things : //// Insurance Do I need to update my homeowners, hazard or flood insurance policy? 
No, your previous mortgage loan servicer will notify your insurance company of your new account number and to change the mortgage clause on your policy ( s ) to the information below. 
//// Accordingly, Chases position appeared to be that its failure to pay was my fault because I had not done something that Chase previously told me I did not have to do. 
//// The Chase representatives ' statements are also at odds with documentation that I have received from the insurance company that indicate that the company had identified Chase as the mortgagee prior to my premium 's due date. 
//// I responded on the phone that their arguments did not make sensethat their first position, that Chase had no responsibility at all to pay my premium, was inconsistent with Chases own actions in XX/XX/XXXX to try to pay the premium ; surely the efforts in XX/XX/XXXX indicated that, on some level, Chase believed itself to be responsible for paying the premium. Second, I took issue with the fact that Chase, upon meeting some resistance, decided to give up and let my insurance lapse, rather than contact me and work with me to resolve the situation. The representatives offered to escalate my situation to an account executive who could assess whether Chase had any fault. I said that my ask was that Chase either waive the requirement that I fill the gap in insurance, or else cover the cost of the gap. I was told that I would receive a response in 3-5 business days. 
//// On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, nearly two weeks after my phone call with Chaseand having never received a follow-up message as promisedI received another letter from Chase, dated XX/XX/XXXX XXXX This letter informed me that this was my second and final notice to provide proof of insurance covering the three-month gap. And, again, that absent such evidence Chase would charge me {$830.00} to fill the gap. I called Chase once again, on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, to inquire about the status of my request from XX/XX/XXXX. 
//// I was told that my request for a waiver had been denied. I was also told a third version of why Chase had failed to pay my premium in XXXX. In Version # 3, Chase did in fact speak to someone at my insurance companya woman named XXXXand according to Chases internal notes, XXXX said that my insurance was paid in full. Of course, it wasn't paid in full, and Chase now concedes that fact. But Chase apparently never asked for written confirmation, and they never contacted me or took any other steps to verify it. They simply stopped trying to pay the premium despite the fact that my mortgage requires them to pay the premium on my behalf, and despite the money that had accumulated in my escrow account for the purpose of paying my insurance premium. It is obvious in retrospect that there was some sort of miscommunication between Chase and the insurance company in that phone call. However, because Chases notation falsely states ( per XXXX ) that my premium had been paid in full, Chase has determined that it is absolved of all responsibility. Chase instead takes the position that I am liable for the effects of its nonpayment, even though I was not even aware of these conversations happening at the time. 
//// On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my insurance agent, and through her the insurance company, to try to verify and understand what Chase had told me. I was told that their records show Chase was sent an invoice and simply never paid it. The insurance company has no notes of communications with Chase, such as the conversation with XXXX. However, I did learn that the company classifies my billing plan as Mortgagee Direct Bill Pay In Full, meaning that the mortgage servicer is directly billed for my premium and is expected to pay the premium in full. It is possible that, in conveying that information to Chase, the Chase representative either misunderstood the insurance representative, or took unclear notes regarding the billing plan that are now being misinterpreted by Chase. Finally, in an effort to avoid Chases high fees, I asked if the insurance company could backdate my current policy to cover the gap from XX/XX/XXXX ; I was told that was not possible to do, and that a retroactive insurance policy does not serve any purpose. 
XXXX// Section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage servicers such as Chase from engaging in unfair XXXX deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. According to the CFPBs exam manual, it considers an act or practice to be unfair where it causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers ; the injury is not reasonably avoidable by consumers ; and the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. 
XXXX Chase, through its incompetence and/or inadequate internal policies and procedures, failed to pay my insurance premium, causing its cancellation. This resulted in significant risk to my home and my family, as we lived in an uninsured home for three months without knowing it. It has also caused me substantial monetary damages, as Chase is now charging me $ 800+ to fix its mistake by requiring me to purchase what amounts to a junk insurance policy. Throughout this entire period, Chase kept me in the darkI could not stop the cancellation of my policy, nor mitigate the risks and damages Chase caused me, because Chase left me unaware that there were any problems with payment of my premium. 
//// My request is that Chase simply take responsibility for its own actions and omissions, and not leave me to suffer the consequences of miscommunications and errors that I had nothing to do with, and about which I was not aware.

86,1/10/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I apologize for bothering you with this low-level case I am humbly requesting that someone please investigate and resolve the below situation for me. Bottom line is that Chase, believing that I was delinquent on my mortgage, coerced me into making an additional mortgage payment on my account for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. When I discovered that this was an error on their part and asked for my additional payment to be returned to me, they agreed that they made an error, but refused to return my money. I need these funds for other bills and am asking that they be returned immediately. Please help. 

Background : At the end of XXXX, I received a notice on XX/XX/XXXX that Chase bought my mortgage from XXXX XXXX Mortgage. My new loan account number at Chase was given as XXXX. 

In XXXX ( I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX ), I contacted Chase to ensure that my mortgage billing information was correct and to enquire when my first bill would be sent to me. At that time, I was told by a Chase representative that I was delinquent on my loan and that I must immediately transfer a payment to Chase or suffer penalties that would include lowering my credit rating. 

Needless to say, I found this threat to be very disturbing. I asked to talk to someone in management and was given to XXXX XXXX, who established a case # XXXX. XXXX also informed me that I was delinquent in paying my XXXX mortgage bill. Not wanting to be delinquent I immediately paid my mortgage bill for XXXX and XXXX with an electronic transfer that day. 

However, I never miss a mortgage payment, so I looked back in my records and found that I sent a mortgage payment to XXXX on XXXX. I checked with XXXX and they had cashed my payment for my XXXX mortgage on XXXX and wired the funds to Chase on XXXX. I called XXXX back and gave her the information and was told Chase had no record of this and I needed to address the problem with XXXX. This began a series of phone calls with Chase and XXXX over the course of the following XXXX weeks. The outcome of these phone calls was that Chase acknowledged that they had indeed received payment, however, they refused to return this payment to me. Instead, they offered to use these funds to pay my XXXX bill. I asked for the money to be returned to me immediately as I have other bills to pay ; Chase refused. I tried numerous times to convince Chase to give me my money back, only to be told that my case is pending. 

At this point, Chase has stopped contacting me, will not return my money, and is obviously profiting from interest earned on my funds every day. While the funds in question are only {$1900.00}, that amount is very important to me. Further, if Chase is following the practice of withholding private funds without consent while they earn interest, that is bank fraud. While I am only XXXX person, if this practice is scaled up, Chase could be making significant profit of off holding funds from others against their will. I have reported this to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Chase has held my funds illegally for over a month.

11,11/11/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"To the Consumer Fiance.gov. 
14 years of Foreclosure with Wells Fargo I am writing to you today to make you aware of my case and situation regarding Wells Fargo bank. I am going to try and give you the short version. We bought land in XXXX, in a small unincorporated town in Texas, called XXXX. XXXX acres ( XXXX -lot XXXX is XXXX plus acres with house and lot XXXX is XXXX plus acres of barre land ), which some people called a swamp. we had a vision to build a log home on the secluded acreage. We cleared the land and did most of the work ourselves. A lot has happened since XXXX of XXXX when I missed my first payment with Wells Fargo. I have never entered into an agreement with Wels Fargo and did not have a mortgage with them. I have refinanced my mortgage in XXXX with XXXX home loan. The interest rate at the time was XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo bought it in a land grab sight unseen. XXXX XXXX # XXXX After losing my job in XXXX, my husband was on XXXX, so I was the principal bread winner of the family. I have XXXX sons, XXXX of which joined the military in the same year, and I was featured in the XXXX morning news. By XXXX I was in foreclosure and begged them for assistance. I had even told them that I had equity in the home, they could use to refinance and put the payments in the back of the note. They had offered to take on the back taxes we owed as well. I knew at the time this would not be a good thing, but our situation worsened. We entered into XXXX forbearances, XXXX in XXXX XXXX, which we made XXXX payments on of {$6500.00}. The XXXX one was for XXXX payments totaling {$9100.00} ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX ). Once completed they where to modify the note. Instead they wanted yet another forebearnce. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a check for {$8200.00}. They denied the moficiation with no explanation. Not even sure how they derived at the number. IF they where so depserate to help us get caught up, why did they return money? They just wanted it to look worse than it really was... Now we are further behind then when we started working with them. 
Never did they ever live up to the promise of giving us a loan modification. Finally in XXXX of XXXX, I had enough. I called the news paper and asked if they would do another article about the military family losing their family home. The newspaper agreed and called the bank about the impending article. It wasnt XXXX hours later ; we got a call from someone claiming to be the secretary to the vice president of Wells Fargo. We knew it wasnt true but at least we got their attention. We finally got the modification! They really didnt modify anything. No interest rate change, they put the past due in a silent second. XXXX mortgages are not allowed in Texas, I guess that is why it was silent? They promised to show us as current, which is what we really wanted so we could refinance with someone else. We mailed checks to Wells Fargo, not the servicing company. This is where they asked us to send it to. It took them until XX/XX/XXXX to finally acknowledge that payments where being applied. See amendent # XXXX and # XXXX Then they said that the taxes increase, which we never got a statement from anyone to prove that. The letter of the increase was received after the date of the start date of the increase. This little amount was enough to show us late again. See Admendment # XXXX and # XXXX I had always made the payments via a paper check. XXXX month when my son was getting married, I had forgotten to transfer the funds to the house paying account. I had already sent the check but by the time I realized I didnt transfer the funds the check had bounced. I called every day for almost XXXX weeks to get someone to assist me. They told me since it was a paper check they where keeping it and would not resubmit it to the bank. I had to stop payment on the check and send a replacement. It even said replacement check in the notes. 
XXXX XXXX # XXXX To this day they have not recognized it was replaced. They told the courts we missed a payment making us look like XXXX XXXX who dont pay their bills. They lied to a federal judge, and no one distributed it. XXXX XXXX # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX the attached statment shows an increase plus late fees even though we made payements in time. See amendment # XXXX They also changed servicing companies without telling us. ( New loan number and everything ). 
During the duration of all this, we had hired a lawyer to help us fighting them because we where not going to give up on the family home. We hired a lawyer who only got paid if we won the case. This went on for years. She sued them for ruining our credit of which we were supposed to receive XXXX dollars but we never got it. It went into the account since we still showed us as behind. XXXX XXXX # XXXX and # XXXX We grew tired of the run around and I had sent a complaint into your agency. You sent the complaint to the Wells Fargo who used it against us in court. They showed that we were dissatisfied with our council. She said that we made her look bad to her other Wells Fargo clients. We were frustrated with the system. Years of being in foreclosure. We hired another attorney ; this one wanted the money we were paying on the mortgage to be paid to them. This went on for several more years. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, I lost my husband of over 40 years. He didnt even have life insurance so I could bury him. I had to sell his belongings just to pay for the funeral. I was devastated. I had nothing ; the house was supposed to be our nest eggA month later ( 8 years after missing our first payment ), I got an email from attorney that I had lost the case. He told me I could continue to fight and appeal the decision. I couldnt do that. The Social security people stopped my husbands XXXX checks immediately. I could NOT keep fighting them, I was exhausted, and devastated. The house was not my main concern. I was trying to figure out how to move forward being single and aloneI hired yet another attorney just to help fight the foreclosure which was sure to come after they won the case. I finally decided I should move closer to work, I could not live there by myself. I turned off the power and water and moved to an apartment. They sent a company to protect their investment This company broke into the house, put a pad lock on the back door and stole property out of the outbuilding. They also stole the original plans to the house which I left on the counter. I could not prove what was stolen. I never abandoned the home. 
Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I am remarried and wanted to get this elephant off my back. My new husband and I wanted to start our new life together and not have this hinder us in the future. The market values of homes XXXX enough where I might be able to sell it and maybe make a little profit. The bank did nothing to help. I got the pay off and they wouldnt help sell it at all. I hired the realtor and finally got a buyer in XX/XX/XXXX. It took until XXXX of XXXX, for the banks to work with us and all the red tape. All this time they where acessing late fees even though we where in a lawsuite disbuting their illegal accounting practices. They even charged attorney fees, while still in disbute. I was still fighting them when the closing occured. See amendment # XXXX The buyers wanted the house bad and hung in there with me while I tried to get them to do anything! They not only made the full amount they claimed I owed ( still no statement ), plus the buyers had to pay all closing costs and the realtors fees. I got nothing!!! I feel this was a big injustice. I paid off the land ( XXXX parcels, XXXX with the house and XXXX was bare land ). I used every favor I had to get electricians and people to help with the build. We did a lot of the work ourselves. Working day and night all for nothing! The house according to XXXX is now worth {$890000.00}, I only owed XXXX. The payoff was {$580000.00}, The sale price was {$620000.00}. The rest was fees and now the new owners have equity! Everyone made money on this house except the owners of the house!!! There is no breakdown of what all this money is for? There never was a statement of charges, just numbers on a peice of paper. Why can they get credit for things they paid and I got nothing for my orogonal invenstment and expenses? I thought I had protection with my homestead in Texas? XXXX XXXX off XXXX # XXXX Whenever I asked why they would not reduce the interest rate when most Amercians ' where refiancing for a XXXX XXXX rate. I was told that the investors where not letting them do that. They where plauing a seroius game with people 's lives prior to XXXX. The investors Did XXXX 's, default swaps with Subprime mortages. I was XXXX of them! They knew the risks, I made no deals with XXXX XXXX or their investors! I thought the federal govemrment helped the mortage companies out, which the Amercian tax payers paid for. I thought we would be protected from these uethecial practices! It is my knowledge they didn't even change the title over until XXXX. How are they collecting money on loans they didn't even have titles to? 
XXXX XXXX # XXXX & # XXXX Not sure why I am sending this or even telling my story. It has never amounted to anything. I dont think you will ever get Wells Fargo to care. They are not a peoples bank! They are greedy and out to make money at any cost to the homeowner. I guess its time to put all these boxes of legal documents into the shredder and move on with my life. Everyone told me I should be happy I am out from under this horrific ordealIts still hard to let go. My first lawyer was right, they will never admit to any wrongdoing. Wish I would have listened instead of going through all that. I could have just given it back to them and let them sell it themselves.

20,10/30/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"14 years of Foreclosure with Wells Fargo I am writing to you today to make you aware of my case and situation regarding Wells Fargo bank. I am going to try and give you the short version. We bought land in XXXX, in a small unincorporated town in Texas, called XXXX. XXXX acres ( XXXX -lot one is XXXX plus acres with house and lot XXXX is XXXX plus acres of barre land ), which some people called a swamp. we had a vision to build a log home on the secluded acreage. We cleared the land and did most of the work ourselves. A lot has happened since XXXX of XXXX when I missed my first payment with Wells Fargo. I have never entered into an agreement with XXXX XXXX and did not have a mortgage with them. I have refinanced my mortgage in XXXX with XXXX home loan. The interest rate at the time was 8.75 %. Wells Fargo bought it in a land grab sight unseen. See Amendment # 1 After losing my job in XXXX, my husband was on XXXX, so I was the principal bread winner of the family. I have XXXX XXXX, XXXX of which joined the military in the same year, and I was featured in the XXXX morning news. By XXXX I was in foreclosure and begged them for assistance. I had even told them that I had equity in the home, they could use to refinance and put the payments in the back of the note. They had offered to take on the back taxes we owed as well. I knew at the time this would not be a good thing, but our situation worsened. We entered into two forbearances, one in XXXX XXXX, which we made three payments on of {$6500.00}. The 2nd one was for 4 payments totaling {$9100.00} ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX ). Once completed they where to modify the note. Instead they wanted yet another forebearnce. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a check for {$8200.00}. They denied the moficiation with no explanation. Not even sure how they derived at the number. IF they where so depserate to help us get caught up, why did they return money? They just wanted it to look worse than it really was... Now we are further behind then when we started working with them. 
Never did they ever live up to the promise of giving us a loan modification. Finally in XXXX of XXXX, I had enough. I called the news paper and asked if they would do another article about the military family losing their family home. The newspaper agreed and called the bank about the impending article. It wasnt 24 hours later ; we got a call from someone claiming to be the secretary to the vice president of Wells Fargo. We knew it wasnt true but at least we got their attention. We finally got the modification! They really didnt modify anything. No interest rate change, they put the past due in a silent second. 2nd mortgages are not allowed in Texas, I guess that is why it was silent? They promised to show us as current, which is what we really wanted so we could refinance with someone else. We mailed checks to Wells Fargo, not XXXX servicing company. This is where they asked us to send it to. It took them until XX/XX/XXXX to finally acknowledge that payments where being applied. See amendent # 2 and # 3 Then they said that the taxes increase, which we never got a statement from anyone to prove that. The letter of the increase was received after the date of the start date of the increase. This little amount was enough to show us late again. See Admendment # 4 and # 5 I had always made the payments via a paper check. One month when my son was getting married, I had forgotten to transfer the funds to the house paying account. I had already sent the check but by the time I realized I didnt transfer the funds the check had bounced. I called every day for almost 4 weeks to get someone to assist me. They told me since it was a paper check they where keeping it and would not resubmit it to the bank. I had to stop payment on the check and send a replacement. It even said replacement check in the notes. 
See Amendment # 6 To this day they have not recognized it was replaced. They told the courts we missed a payment making us look like dead beats who dont pay their bills. They lied to a federal judge, and no one distributed it. See Amendment # 7 On XX/XX/XXXX the attached statment shows an increase plus late fees even though we made payements in time. See amendment # 8 They also changed servicing companies without telling us. ( New loan number and everything ).

During the duration of all this, we had hired a lawyer to help us fighting them because we where not going to give up on the family home. We hired a lawyer who only got paid if we won the case. This went on for years. She sued them for ruining our credit of which we were supposed to receive XXXX dollars but we never got it. It went into the account since we still showed us as behind. See Adendment # 9 and # 10 We grew tired of the run around and I had sent a complaint into your agency. You sent the complaint to the Wells Fargo who used it against us in court. They showed that we were dissatisfied with our council. She said that we made her look bad to her other Wells Fargo clients. We were frustrated with the system. Years of being in foreclosure. We hired another attorney ; this one wanted the money we were paying on the mortgage to be paid to them. This went on for several more years. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, I lost my husband of over 40 years. He didnt even have life insurance so I could bury him. I had to sell his belongings just to pay for the funeral. I was devastated. I had nothing ; the house was supposed to be our nest eggA month later ( 8 years after missing our first payment ), I got an email from attorney that I had lost the case. He told me I could continue to fight and appeal the decision. I couldnt do that. The Social security people stopped my husbands XXXX checks immediately. I could NOT keep fighting them, I was exhausted, and devastated. The house was not my main concern. I was trying to figure out how to move forward being single and aloneI hired yet another attorney just to help fight the foreclosure which was sure to come after they won the case. I finally decided I should move closer to work, I could not live there by myself. I turned off the power and water and moved to an apartment. They sent a company to protect their investment This company broke into the house, put a pad lock on the back door and stole property out of the outbuilding. They also stole the original plans to the house which I left on the counter. I could not prove what was stolen. I never abandoned the home. 
Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I am remarried and wanted to get this elephant off my back. My new husband and I wanted to start our new life together and not have this hinder us in the future. The market values of homes rose enough where I might be able to sell it and maybe make a little profit. The bank did nothing to help. I got the pay off and they wouldnt help sell it at all. I hired the realtor and finally got a buyer in XX/XX/XXXX. It took until XXXX of XXXX, for the banks to work with us and all the red tape. All this time they where acessing late fees even though we where in a lawsuite disbuting their illegal accounting practices. They even charged attorney fees, while still in disbute. I was still fighting them when the closing occured. See amendment # 11 The buyers wanted the house bad and hung in there with me while I tried to get them to do anything! They not only made the full amount they claimed I owed ( still no statement ), plus the buyers had to pay all closing costs and the realtors fees. I got nothing!!! I feel this was a big injustice. I paid off the land ( 2 parcels, one with the house and one was bare land ). I used every favor I had to get electricians and people to help with the build. We did a lot of the work ourselves. Working day and night all for nothing! The house according to XXXX is now worth {$890000.00}, I only owed XXXX. The payoff was {$580000.00}, The sale price was {$620000.00}. The rest was fees and now the new owners have equity! Everyone made money on this house except the owners of the house!!! There is no breakdown of what all this money is for? There never was a statement of charges, just numbers on a peice of paper. Why can they get credit for things they paid and I got nothing for my orogonal invenstment and expenses? I thought I had protection with my homestead in Texas? See Pay off Amendment # 12 Whenever I asked why they would not reduce the interest rate when most Amercians ' where refiancing for a 2 % rate. I was told that the investors where not letting them do that. They where plauing a seroius game with people 's lives prior to XXXX. The investors Did XXXX 's, default swaps with Subprime mortages. I was one of them! They knew the risks, I made no deals with Wells Fargo or their investors! I thought the federal govemrment helped the mortage companies out, which the Amercian tax payers paid for. I thought we would be protected from these uethecial practices! It is my knowledge they didn't even change the title over until XXXX. How are they collecting money on loans they didn't even have titles to?

See Amendment # 13 & # 14 Not sure why I am sending this or even telling my story. It has never amounted to anything. I dont think you will ever get Wells Fargo to care. They are not a peoples bank! They are greedy and out to make money at any cost to the homeowner. I guess its time to put all these boxes of legal documents into the shredder and move on with my life. Everyone told me I should be happy I am out from under this horrific ordealIts still hard to let go. My first lawyer was right, they will never admit to any wrongdoing. Wish I would have listened instead of going through all that. I could have just given it back to them and let them sell it themselves.

Back in XXXX of XXXX Wells Fargo Home Mortgage sent us a thick packet of forms with a letter saying that they have a discrepancy with our information in their system because my wife 's name is incorrect with the IRS. That made no sense to us at all, so we called their customer service line. After spending at least an hour on the phone with them, my wife found out that they keep entering her maiden name as her middle name on their end at Wells Fargo and then their computers spit out an error message and then they just send out that thick packet in the mail with tons of repetitive forms to fill out. But the mistake is at Wells Fargo. Whoever is inputting my wife 's information at Wells Fargo is doing it wrong. We had to escalate it with their team and explain the situation for an hour-plus, dealing with multiple customer service people and their managers. At the end of this they finally guaranteed that they fixed it, and it wouldn't happen again. 

But then here we are over a year later and this week another thick packet in the mailbox arrived from Wells Fargo with the exact same name discrepancy issue. You don't understand how infuriating this is. 

I also remember that last year they began to send us escalating letters in RED envelopes that said threatening things like "" YOUR MORTGAGE IS IN JEOPARDY '' that were clearly trying to scare us. 

I just spent another hour on the phone with customer service person "" XXXX '', and then his manager "" XXXX '' explaining this enraging whole situation. Now XXXX promises me that they will correct the issue ( yeah sure ) and now I have to wait two more business days for someone even higher up on the "" executive escalation team '' to call me back. I have little faith that it is going to be corrected as we have literally gone through all of this with them over a year ago. 

This is ridiculous. I no longer have any patience for Wells Fargo and their incompetence. I hate huge behemoth companies like Wells Fargo that do this kind of thing to their customers, and we just have to sit out here and take it and give them multiple hours of our time dealing with their incompetence and fake guarantees that things are taken care of when they aren't, but don't worry XXXX XXXX XXXX here is a reference number for you so you can be assured that this was taken care of this time. 

Nope. 

Lastly, we are good customers. We are far ahead on our mortgage payments and have never had a late payment. My wife and I have excellent credit and good income. We shouldn't have to be bullied by a large mortgage company over the phone and through the mail to fix an issue that they caused. My wife shouldn't have to fill out 15 pages of forms because someone at Wells Fargo entered her information incorrectly. I am so sick of having to explain all of this to their customer service person only to then be passed off to a manager and then have to explain it all over again. And then they still don't correct the issue. I'm done. DONE. 

Please, if you can help me, I need it. I am so sick of dealing with them. I am sick of fake customer service people pretending they care when they don't.

2 ). Wells Fargo provides a phone number - "" If you have any questions, please contact us at XXXX '' however this number only has programmed information and as far as I could tell no access to ask a persons questions like : * Does hazard insurance mean homeowners insurance? 
* Do you need the entire policy or just a 'proof of insurance '?

* What is the timeline before you purchase insurance and try to make me pay for it?

In XX/XX/XXXX, these unapplied funds equalled more than 4 monthly mortgage payments. Wells Fargo then filed for foreclosure, even though the ony reason we were behind was because they were placing our payments ( made by certified checks sent directly from the bank ) into unapplied funds instead of promptly crediting them as payments. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, a late payment was made due to the passing of my father-in-law and the need to cover his funeral expenses. 

According to an agreement entered into on XX/XX/XXXX, there could be one cure period if a payment was missed. According to Wells Fargo, this cure period took place on or about XX/XX/XXXX. However, there were no missed payments, these were only part of the {$10000.00} in unapplied funds. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo began to reject certified payments, sending back our XX/XX/XXXX payment. They now admit that they are no longer accepting payments. I believe they are only doing so to force a default as there is no sound reason for doing so. 

Also, Wells Fargo is dual tracking. I have had an active request of mortgage modification for almost 9 months. Wells Fargo states that a modification takes approximately 30 days, this has taken more than 8 months because Wells Fargo has taken so long to process the modification that the documents have become stale dated, due to the fact that more than 4 months elapses before they begin to process the documents submitted.There is no reason that a mortgage modification should be going into its ninth month except for the willful indifference or deliberate malfeasance of the lender. 

Also, Wells Fargo has included {$1200.00} in legal fees in what they claim are "" arrears ''. Also, Wells Fargo has cut us off from access to our monthly statements and has refused to send us duplicate statements we have been requesting in order to document all of their errors. 

They have instead sent us spreadsheets with information that omits such unauthorized charges such as legal fees. Wells Fargo has no explanation as to why we can not get access to the online portal to view our payment history except that they do not want us to document their accounting errors.

41,8/30/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I have a standard Home Mortgage with Wells Fargo and since XXXX have had excess payments applied incorrectly to the Mortgage Loan Interest instead of applying the full amount of the excess payments to the Loan Principal. Initially the excess loan payments were applied correctly where the full amount was applied to the Loan Principal however subsequent excess payments were applied to the Loan Interest and not the Loan Principal. 
On the monthly Wells Fargo Loan coupon for the Loan repayment, the current payment amount due is clearly indicated. I began making excess payments over the current amount due for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and the excess payment was applied correctly to the Loan Principal. This was also correctly applied for the next 2 consecutive months in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and then it stopped. I continued to send excess payments in addition to the Loan Payment amount due each month, however the excess payments were applied to the Interest and not applied fully to the Loan Principal. This practice continued until the payment in XX/XX/XXXX wherein the excess payment above the Loan amount was again applied correctly to the Principal. 
I had assumed the payments were being applied correctly as they were initially and hadnt taken notice. As the Loan amount did not appear correct, I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told by the Service Representative that my account was on a Pre-Paid Plan and there was a pre-paid MPL code on my account which is why the additional payments were not being applied fully to the Principal. I was told that this Pre-Paid Plan could only have been requested by me and it was removed by the Service Representative during our phone conversation. I had never contacted Wells Fargo Home Mortgage regarding my Loan until that day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), nor have I ever requested anything related to a Pre-Paid Plan, to which Wells Fargo has provided no proof of any request made by me regarding this plan. Further I was told by the Service Representative that only the past 3 months payments ( 90 days ) could be corrected. 

I have a case opened with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Case # xxxxxxxx, Inquiry on Loan # xxxxxxxxxxx, however upon their investigation they had re-stated they can only credit back 3 months. In total they have applied {$31000.00} towards the Loan Interest which should have been applied to the Loan Principal. The feedback I have received from Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is that they believe the account was handled properly and no corrections are needed because no error occurred and stated that payments made more than 90 calendar days can not be reversed and reapplied unless there was an issue caused by Wells Fargo. 

Upon continued escalation, Wells Fargo performed additional investigation to which I have received the following response on XX/XX/XXXX, We are denying your request to reverse payments prior to XX/XX/XXXX, due policy, time frame, and the tax implications. 

On the Wells Fargo payment coupon, it states the following : If you would like to make an extra payment toward the loan principal, please indicate with the payment that it is intended for pre-payment of principal, and we will evaluate whether the payment is eligible for a principal pre-payment based on the account status. If we receive funds in excess of the total amount due without instructions, those excess funds may be applied to future contractual payments, fees, costs, escrow shortages or principal, depending upon the specifics of the accounts and the amount of the funds received. Each monthly Loan payment sent was double the Loan amount due. 

Wells Fargo has : 1 ) Acted unethically in applying the excess payments to the Loan Interest versus the Loan Principal.

2 ) Not provided any valid reason for why those previous payments were applied correctly and why there were stopped.

3 ) Not provided a reason why my account was marked as being on a pre-paid plan to not apply excess payments to the Loan Principal until contacted on XXXX XXXX to understand the discrepancies.

4 ) Not provided any proof showing there was any request made to put the Loan on a pre-paid plan.

5 ) Not provided any policy to contradict their Loan payment coupon documentation regarding excess payments that would preclude them from not being applied to the Loan Principal.

6 ) Not provided the issue related to the time frame.

7 ) Not provided what are the tax implications.

Wells Fargo is culpable in how the excess payments were mishandled and need to rectify by re-applying the excess payments towards the Loan Principal.

I wish to request that the amount misapplied by Wells Fargo wrongly towards legal fees and expenses disbursements contrary to the compliance requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures ( RESPA ) and its implementing regulation, Regulation X. This also constitutes violations of the Consumer financial Protection Act of XXXX. 
These monies meant for the purpose of principal payments, interest and escrow ( taxes etc. ) payments were not applied ; accordingly, rather used to settle legal fees without any disclosure ( s ) to the borrower at any time.

Wells Fargo had accepted that only the sums of {$3400.00} and {$3400.00} was applied from the loan accounts for legal fees/costs and foreclosure costs respectively ( see Exhibits 1 and 2 attached ). Howbeit, the loan account activity statement provided by Wells Fargo specifically for years XXXX and XXXX, clearly confirms that {$22000.00} was misapplied for legal fees and disbursements ( see Exhibits A and B attached ). 
The New York State Laws states that not more than {$600.00} should be expended to recover any debts from the borrowers loan account ( See Exhibits C attached ) In XXXX, the borrower requested that the unutilized balances in the borrowers loan account including the excess legal fees be credited and applied to the loan principal account which was then in arrears of two-months in the sum of {$8600.00}, to fulfil the requirements of the XX/XX/XXXX modification agreement with XXXX XXXXWells Fargo for the forgiveness of the deferred 2nd principal amount of {$140000.00} conditioned on the borrower not being in arrears of 3 months mortgage payments at any time ( Exhibits 4 and 7 attached ) Wells Fargo did not resolve my concerns nor honor my request; but instead, immediately : 1 ) Cancelled the loan forgiveness of {$140000.00} stating the borrower had violated the terms of the modification agreement and 2 ) Transferred the servicing of the loan to a new servicer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX",Mortgage/ payments,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NY,10801,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,8/17/2022,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,5828179
51,7/28/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I've had a conventional mortgage with Wells Fargo since XXXX. In XXXX I refinanced my mortgage utilizing the HAMP program which required I keep an escrow account to pay for annual insurance and property taxes. In XX/XX/XXXX during the Covid-19 pandemic I enrolled in the mortgage forebearance program deferring my mortgage payments for 6 months. At the end of the forebearance program Wells Fargo required I repay the missed payments which totaled almost {$10000.00}. I could not repay the missed payments but I did resume paying my monthy mortgage payments including escrow account fees. In XX/XX/XXXX I repaid all the payments missed from when I was in the forebearance program. In XXXX of XXXX I made a large payment, {$50000.00}, towards the loan principal reducing the loan principal balance to around {$53000.00}. I also asked Wells Fargo to eliminate the requirement I keep an escrow account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo telling me they would not eliminate the escrow account requirement because I had allegedly missed payments.

52,7/21/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I purchased a home in NC in XX/XX/XXXX. My mortgage was then purchased by Wells Fargo. I received my annual escrow report in XXXX and found that I had an escrow shortage of {$5600.00}. I looked through the report and found that Wells Fargo had made 2 payments in the amount of {$4700.00} to insurance companies that I had never heard of and did not have policies with. They made a payment from my escrow account to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$4700.00}. That amount was then credited back to my escrow account by XXXX because I do not, and I have never had, a policy with them. The next month ( XX/XX/XXXX ) Wells Fargo made a payment from my escrow account to XXXX, another insurance company, in the amount of {$4700.00}. I do not, and have never had, a policy with this company. This amount has never been returned to my escrow account and it is causing a large shortage in the account and has caused my monthly mortgage payment to increase by over {$530.00} a month. Wells Fargo did make a correct payment to my actual insurance company in XX/XX/XXXX from my escrow account. 

Since discovering the mistake made by Wells Fargo I have made many calls to customer service and to their insurance department. For the first several calls Wells Fargo insisted it was impossible for this to happen. I had to investigate myself and made contact with XXXX XXXX and XXXX insurance. Both confirmed I do not have policies with them and they do not know why Wells Fargo sent them payments from my escrow. XXXX confirmed they immediately returned the payment when it was received. XXXX advised that they immediately returned the payment but Wells Fargo says they never received it. 

I have spent hours on the phone over the last 4 months with insurance agents ( one in Hawaii with XXXX ), Wells Fargo customer service and Wells Fargo 's insurance department. Because Wells Fargo could not believe there was any mistake, I had to do all of the initial investigation myself and prove to them a mistake had been made. I believed that Wells Fargo would then correct the mistake but to date they have not. Since the mistake was confirmed I have spent weeks trying to get my escrow account refunded. I continued to have email contact with XXXX and they advised that they had, at least 2 more times, sent Wells Fargo a check to refund my account. When I contacted Wells Fargo about the payments they insist they never got them. Wells Fargo has told me on multiple occasions that they are 'escalating ' their level of attention to the matter but so far they have not produced any results. I even put Well Fargo in direct contact with XXXX to properly direct the refund payment. This has not produced a result. My last contact with Wells Fargo was last week and I was once again told they were going to escalate their efforts. At that point I demanded that Wells Fargo refund the money that they took from my escrow account. I told them that I have had to do all of the foot work to resolve their mistake. I told them that they were responsible for this and they should immediately refund my escrow account and they could figure out how to get refunded by XXXX. 

To date Wells Fargo has been unable to explain why they made payments to two different insurance companies that I do not, and have never, had policies with. Neither insurance company has any idea why Wells Fargo sent them the payments. 

This has caused a great deal of stress both emotionally and financially on my family.

54,7/12/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"My mortgage is through Wells Fargo. Just recently, I noticed Wells Fargo purchased a 3rd party insurance for my condo - going back to XXXX. This additional insurance coverage stayed on my condo from XXXX - XXXX ( three years ). This was fraudulent and baseless because there was never a lapse in my original/existing insurance coverage. Wells Fargo enlisted me in this additional insurance program for $ XXXX/year, so I am owed {$2100.00}. When I complained, Wells Fargo asked for me to provide insurance Declarations page for each year 's worth of coverage, and they would refund ME the {$2100.00}. They know they were wrong and refunded the money - however it went back into my Escrow account. All my conversations were then directed to the Escrow Department, who told me I will only get {$700.00} back. Again, it is illegal to force a consumer to purchase 3rd party insurance and I deserve my money back. 

This complaint gets incredibly worse. Wells Fargo is single-handedly the worst company anyone can ever deal with. You'll never deal with the same person, they tell you that you need to talk to another department, and worse yet - anytime you are making progress in talking to someone, the phone gets cut off and you'll never hear from that person again. When I call back, I need to explain the WHOLE story all over again and the process starts all over again. 

After my initial dealings were with the Wells Fargo insurance department, I called Wells Fargo and requested to speak with a higher level of management. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was introduced to XXXX who identified herself from the Wells Fargo Executive Office. She told me she would start a new case on my behalf, and Wells Fargo would investigate. She was OVERLY nice, almost too nice. It seemed too good to be true, and IT WAS. 

XXXX gave me a direct contact number to reach her at XXXX. Funny situation that arises, that number goes right voicemail. And no voicemails can be left. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was called by XXXX from the Wells Fargo Escrow Department ( who I had never spoke to before ) and he told me that I was entitled to a refund of {$700.00}. He thought he was giving me good news, and had no idea of my dealings with XXXX. When I mentioned my conversation with XXXX, XXXX said there is no case for my complaint on the insurance fraud or {$2100.00} being owed me. WELLS FARGO did absolutely NOTHING to investigate or solve my case. 

What's even worse, is that XXXX doesn't work in the Executive Office. That was a blatant lie and a form of deception. XXXX confirmed for me that the Executive Office is a higher level of management, and that ( if I'm talking to the Executive Office ), then he shouldn't have called me! After telling XXXX my whole story, he told me I am only due {$700.00}. Actually, he said he could DO ME A FAVOR and send me {$800.00}! 

The STORY gets WORSE! In my dealing with XXXX, he got to understand the ENTIRE SITUATION ( how the insurance department owed ME {$2100.00} ), he said he'd escalate to the Executive Office. BUT, we got cut off ( shocking )! and I never heard from XXXX again!! He had my phone number, and could have easily called me back. So to reconnect, I called XXXX 's phone number and extension multiple times. But again, Wells Fargo does this on purpose. They want me to go in circles and GIVE UP! XXXX 's number is ( XXXX x XXXX ), This gets WORSE! After speaking with the fifth person on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX directed me to XXXX XXXX, who is quite frankly the biggest scam artist of everyone. After 90-minutes on the phone, XXXX XXXX made the situation WORSE! Again, this is Wells Fargo 's deceitful approach to make the consumer give up. XXXX XXXX said she worked in the Executive Office, but she couldn't give me answers. What's worse, is she repeatedly said she didn't want to know what my issue was. In my disgust for customer service, she decided to create CASE # XXXX, which was a formal complaint about Wells Fargo 's customer service. I informed her I wanted CASE # XXXX handled, and not to waste our time on CASE # XXXX. BUT SHE INSISTED, CASE # XXXX would take priority! After wasting 2.5-hours with Wells Fargo - I have no other option but to file a formal complaint here. XXXX XXXX willfully and blatantly dragged my call on without providing ANY form of help or problem-solving techniques. I reiterated that she didn't know my problem, so it would be impossible for her to solve my problem. 

To add to this story is almost impossible, but it get 's worse. I asked XXXX XXXX for my case numbers, but she said her system was down and she'd place me on a brief hold for my case numbers. After a 5-minute hold, I got Case # XXXX She placed me on hold again to obtain CASE # XXXX, but after waiting 15-minutes on hold for this- I was cut off ( I KNOW, SHOCKING isn't it )! And no, XXXX XXXX did not call me back. I never heard from her again. 

This entire experience is incredible. They rob me of {$2100.00} and make no attempt to fix the situation. They lied to me on several occasions! And I have ZERO confidence in Wells Fargo going forward. This is ILLEGAL to wrongfully purchase insurance for someone.

All I had to say was yes pause my payments and they would extend my term by how many months i decided to pause my payments. 

At that time my payments were a little more {$1900.00} dollars a month. Although I had a year to stay in the program, After 5 months my business was back up and running. I called Wells Fargo and everything went bad. Wells Fargo representatives explained to me that they made a mistake and give me false information. They stated that they did not 'pause '' payment, and the payments did continue. In fact, when I got out of the program. each payment that I missed would be taxed on to the principle! Meaning each month the Principle of my loan increased by the amount on my mortgage payment. The amount I owed went up by more that {$10000.00}!!! Even more, while disputing the mis-information, I could not get out of the "" pause '' because that would trigger the increase principle payment. 

During this time of dispute, I paid my mortgage payments on time. None of the mortgage payment went to my account. For over a year, my payment went into a "" non-asset '' account. Over {$20000.00} was place in this account. Although Ive paid the agree time, My Principle balance is more than {$12000.00} more than what it was 2 years ago and a {$22000.00} payment that is also due. 

To make thing even worst, While we were disputing this issue Wells Fargo sold my loan to the ABSOLUTE WORST loan servicer possible, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Although I was paying on time, Wells Fargo threaten to foreclose on my home. To keep from a foreclosure Wells Fargo worked out a new 40 year loan payment program which XXXX said they would honor. After just 1 payment XXXX raised my payment by {$100.00} a month. They stated this was a escrow audit. This is a lie. I know because 1 ) the escrow department stated that they did not do and escrow assessment on my account and 2 ) My insurance actually went down 3 ) My taxes never changed. 

The biggest issue is my the $ XXXX dollars that was not applied to my account from Wells Fargo was never transferred to XXXX. To this day, my XXXX account is showing a payment due of $ XXXX I strongly believe that Ive being scammed. At no time have I ever missed and agreed payment. While doing my research Both Wells Fargo and XXXX have a history of defrauding people with deceptive practices. 

Have have all records and many phone recordings to back up my claim. Is this something you can help me with or direct me to someone that can assist in this legal matter.

66,6/4/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"This is a Report on Well Fargo Fraudulent Forbearance Covid This is a complaint that I have been a victim of fraud by Wells Fargo. I will introduce myself Im a 25 year retired XXXX XXXX and accumulated rental property during my work XXXX XXXX  at a XXXX XXXX I have two mortgages with my rental property using Wells Fargo. Unfortunately I fell into a forbearance when the Covid hit and dealing with renters loosing jobs and my short term rentals not receiving income. I was basically in a cash crunch. I have been a very dedicated client of Wells Fargo since 2011 never missed a payment and for years paid over my mortgage bc I wanted a shorter contract. Unfortunately when the Covid hit listening to I felt from reliable people decided to get on the Wells Fargo Forbearance program. I asked questions and was told that this forbearance was an extension to my current mortgage. I noted later after getting my monthly mortgage statements they listed a second principal balance which what I assume my forbearance as a second principal mortgage. I thought that was strange and after my first principal was deducted I sent money on the second principal balance and they did not deduct from the second principal mortgage but only the first principal mortgage. I called in about it and they said that the second principal balance was due to house and urban developing loan that I got and they sent information on that. I never remember receiving anything from house and urban development. I later called wanting to please pay off that second principal balance repeatedly and told it was a VA loan and now a XXXX XXXX loan. It gets worse I call for weeks wanting to pay off the forbearance loan and told I cant they have to investigate this through phone calls which now I come through the point reading through Wells Fargo fraudulent history they could possibly doctor my calls and possibly drop calls. I was told they will find a resolution by Friday XX/XX/XXXX. Now finding a voice call they will not find a resolution until XX/XX/XXXX. My impatience has run dry with Wells Fargo and feel others need to know the reality of Wells Fargo fraudulent forbearance program.

67,6/2/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX - Wells Fargo communicates availability of COVID forbearance for both of my mortgages with them. I apply, and both mortgages are accepted for relief. 
XXXX XXXX, their forbearance acceptance notification clarified the possible restructuring/repayment options available at the conclusion of the forbearance : "" These programs may include continuing suspension of payments, moving the suspended payments to the end of the loan, or a modification to help with longer term financial changes. '' XXXX XXXX. Without consulting me or securing my approval, Wells restructures the payments missed under forbearance into a "" second unpaid principal balance '', essentially a second mortgage or balloon payment that can not be paid off or even paid down until the first principal balance is fully paid off. Their previously described program to move payments to the end of the loan was never discussed or provided as an option to me. I did not apply for second mortgages with Wells as part of the COVID relief restructuring, nor did I ever agree that my missed forbearance payments should be turned into a second mortgage balance that could only be paid in a lump sum after the first mortgage balance was fully paid off. 
XXXX XXXX - I resume my regular mortgage payments, which I have continued to make faithfully and on time until now. 
XXXX XXXX- I attempt to apply for Home Equity Loans, Home Equity Lines of Credit with other banks to do home maintenance and am told that the "" second unpaid principal balance '' automatically disqualifies me from additional financing, despite having an excellent credit score and payment history. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - I inform Wells of this situation, asking them to restructure the loan so that the suspended payments are moved to the end of the first loan, or to spread out the payments for the second balance across the remaining term of each first mortgage. Their representatives refuse to do this, referring me to XXXX XXXX as having oversight of the second balance, and steering me to apply for a refinance ( at today 's much higher rates, and involving thousands of dollars of unnecessary fees ). I call XXXX XXXX and am informed that Wells is the servicer of both balances and that Wells has to follow the CARES guidelines, and that they should escalate my concern to their XXXX  representative ( s ). I call Wells again to inform them that they are responsible for providing reasonable servicing options for the second principal balance, but they tell me I have to pay the second balance off in one lump sum, whether now or at the end of the loan. The same day, as an experiment, I make payments on both of my mortgages, adding {$100.00} additional principal to each payment. The payment system does not allow me to select which balance ( first or second ) these additional principal payments would apply to. I call XXXX XXXX again, and their representative decides to escalate my case, while also recommending that I file complaints with the FTC and CFPB. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- Wells generates new statements for both of my mortgages. The additional principal amounts were both applied to the first balances. I call Wells to ask if these additional principal payments can be applied to the second mortgage. The Wells representative tells me they can not, that the second balances can only be paid off as lump sums after the first balances are paid off in their entirety. I ask for documentation of this. Wells sends me a document from XX/XX/XXXX, detailing these terms, "" You will be responsible for paying the past-due amounts upon the maturity date of the mortgage or earlier upon the sale or transfer of the property, refinance of the mortgage loan, or payoff of the interest-bearing unpaid principal balance. The payment deferral balance can't be pre-paid prior to maturity or payoff. '' In summary, the CARES guidelines for mortgage lenders say that borrowers have to repay, but that they can *repay over time*. Wells is not complying with these guidelines, refusing to allow me to repay my missed payments *over time*, and causing me financial harm by preventing me from gaining access to other financing ( including 3rd party payoffs of the second principal balances ), and trying to steer me into an unnecessary and costly refinance. Essentially Wells is harming me financially because they turned the COVID forbearance into a second mortgage that locks me into an abusive financial relationship with them, with no flexibility and no way out except at enormous cost to myself.

73,5/23/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"I have an adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) with Wells Fargo Bank that adjusts yearly depending on the interest rate. I contacted Wells Fargo Bank Customer Care and XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2022, after receiving a Payment Change Notice indicating that the interest rate on my arm was changing. I knew interest rates on mortgages was raising and totally understood that I would be paying more interest on the remaining amount on my loan. The Payment Change Notice also showed the amount of my monthly payment going to Principal was being reduced from {$2200.00} to {$2000.00}. This results in a decrease of my monthly payment in the amount of {$210.00} being applied to Principal. In my XXXX call to Wells Fargo, I asked them to explain why a rise in my interest rate also meant a decrease in the amount of my payment being applied to Principal. Their response was to send me the formula on how they calculate my new payment which doesn't explain why the decrease in applying my payment to Principal. I have a 30 year mortgage and if they keep reducing the amount I pay to Principal, I will not have my mortgage paid off in 30 years. I believe Wells Fargo has developed a formula they are using to calculate new payments that decrease amounts paid to Principal so the loan will not be paid off in 30 years and will necessitate taking out a new mortgage with them. 

Since it is an interest rate increase, it would logically follow that the increase in my monthly payment should be applied to interest only - not to subtracting the amount being applied to Principal. So far, the only information I have received from Wells Fargo is a letter showing the formula they use to calculate the new payment. I need to know WHY Wells Fargo allows for an interest rate increase also results in a reduction in the Principal. My total monthly payment has gone up so its not like Wells Fargo is trying to keep my payment within a certain amount. I am willing to pay whatever the rise in interest rate dictates on the balance of my mortgage owed. It doesn't make rational sense, however, for Wells Fargo to keep decreasing the amount being applied to Principal. 

Please help me understand how the bank can keep decreasing amounts paid to Principal even though I am making much, much higher monthly payments based on interest rate increases that should be applied to Interest only. 

Like with my response from them, please don't let their response to you be only a "" business '' formula they use to appear to be a legitimate way they calculate new payments. Applying an interest rate increase to a mortgage should be straight forward. An increase in the amount of the monthly payment based on an interest rate increase should be applied to the amount of interest I am paying not on subtracting from Principal XXXX pay. 

I feel that the formula Wells Fargo is using for my loan is also being applied to other ARM loans for other people. Given Wells Fargo history of fraudulent activity which they have paid fines for, I am now under the impression this may be another Scam used by Wells Fargo to ensure ARM mortgages are not paid off within their 30 year timeframe so another loan will have to be taken out with them.

86,4/19/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"A letter dated XX/XX/XXXX informed me that recent Wells Fargo escrow analysis revealed a {$12000.00} shortfall in my escrow account. Their solution : to pay the lump sum by XX/XX/XXXX or effectively doubling my monthly mortgage XXXX & XXXX payment ( {$1600.00} to {$3300.00} ) starting on XX/XX/XXXX. How did this shortfall arise? Probably when Wells acquired the loan in XX/XX/XXXX and subsequently failed to perform the proper escrow analysis when they became the new mortgage servicer. 

I called Wells customer care on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, the only option they gave in lieu of doubling my monthly payment was the following : instead of paying the shortfall over a XXXX period ( doubles my monthly payment ) the customer service rep ( XXXX ) offered a XXXX re-payment period for the {$12000.00} shortfall ( almost doubling my monthly payment ). I said I need to spread that shortfall payment out over a longer term, which I'm sure they can offer but after transferring me to their Escrow Department, the Escrow Department refused. Instead, they told me to call their Home Preservation group the last week of May and explain it to them. That's their Loan Modification group. I told the Escrow Department Rep that I don't need a loan mod, I just need Wells Fargo to give me a longer term to make up the escrow shortfall that was a result of their mistake. 

Again, ( 1 ) I don't think that it's appropriate that my only choices are either a {$12000.00} lump sum payment due in a couple of weeks, or an abrupt doubling of the XXXX & XXXX payment that is due to their mistake.

90,4/6/2022,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,NA,"Thank you for your letter dated the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. While I appreciate your acknowledging that my home value is currently well above the threshold needed for me to request for cancellation of PMI, I respectfully disagree with your conclusion that PMI can not be canceled. Specifically, I have reviewed the documents provided at closing that relate to PMI insurance. Further, I have reviewed the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 ( Act ) and the XX/XX/XXXX amendment ( Amendment ) to the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 ( Act ) and neither the paperwork provided at closing nor the Act nor the Amendment disclose any such requirement that in addition to meeting the 80 % XXXX threshold, that significant improvements are needed to have PMI canceled such as outlined in your letter. 
Wells Fargos website indicates a consumer can request cancellation of PMI by paying {$100.00} fee for a home valuation, which I paid. This home valuation is to be used in lieu of the original amortization schedule provided at closing. The only other stipulation that would prohibit PMI from being canceled relates to payment delinquencies, for which I have had none. I paid the {$100.00} in good faith because I knew my homes value had increased. Therefore, I can only conclude Wells Fargos decision to deny my request for cancellation of PMI to be unfair. 
Wells Fargo enriched itself by collecting the {$100.00} fee and even though my homes value has met the XXXX threshold for canceling PMI, Wells Fargo refuses to do so based on an arbitrary, and completely undisclosed, reason. I wonder how many other Wells Fargo customers have also been denied their rightful cancellation of PMI? 
Section 5 of the FTC Act sets forth the standards for acts that are Unfair and Deceptive ( XXXX  ). The XXXX XXXX XXXX added an Abusive test ( XXXX  ). An act or practices is defined as unfair when : The act or practice must cause or be likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. 
Consumers must not be reasonably able to avoid the injury. 
The injury must not be outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. 
Wells Fargo refusal to terminate PMI on my loan is unfair because I am required to pay {$37.00} each month until automatic cancellation is reached ( XX/XX/XXXX ), which is based on the amortization schedule provided at closing even though my homes XXXX is significantly above the original value. There is no way for me to avoid paying this monthly insurance premium ( i.e., the injury ) even though my homes value has met the XXXX requirement for cancellation. Wells Fargo is denying my request to cancel based on an arbitrary reason ; therefore, I am unable to avoid the injury. Finally, there are no countervailing benefits to me to outweigh this injury. 

I recognize that home values during the pandemic have increased more than home values have historically increased. However, historically, based on both XXXX and XXXX data, the average annual home value appreciation is between 3 and 5 percent annually. 
My home was valued at {$200000.00} when I purchased it in XX/XX/XXXX. If you apply the low end of the historical home value appreciation ( i.e., 3 % ), the value of my home would be projected to be over {$210000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. According to your letter, the value only needs to be {$200000.00}. So even based on historical, and not pandemic induced appreciation, I have met the threshold for requesting PMI to be canceled. 
Further, had someone from Wells Fargo reached out to me before making this arbitrary decision to deny my request for cancellation to ask if I had made any significant improvements to my home, I could have informed them of the following improvements : Updates made All walls have been installed with new insulation, landscaped around the house to correct grade for proper water removal from house and surrounding land, remodeled kitchen with a new countertop surface and backsplash, repaired foundations of garage, as well as cracks in the brick along the front of the house, replaced chimney crown I am a reasonable consumer and based on a reasonable consumers knowledge of the Homeowners Protection Act, which stipulate that PMI can be requested by the borrower to be canceled and based on Wells Fargos website which indicates PMI can be canceled if the value has increased ( and not based solely on the initial amortization provided at closing ) after paying the {$100.00} fee, I am filing a complaint directly with Wells Fargo again requesting PMI to be canceled. Further, I am copying Wells Fargos two banking regulators ( the OCC and the CFPB ) on this complaint because, as I indicated above, there is the potential that Wells Fargo applied this same arbitrary and unfair act to deny other consumers request for cancellation of PMI.

I called and spoke with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a lady named XXXX. She advised the increase of payment was due to the taxes which were {$4100.00} and increasing to {$4700.00}. Which a {$600.00} increase does not call for that much of a shortage. she also advised the XXXX was also collecting for a shortage from the prior servicer which Im assuming is from about XXXX years ago since my loan just originated in XXXX.
